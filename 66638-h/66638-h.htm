</div>

<p>It may be well to state at the outset in what respects the
present work differs from <i>A Reader’s Guide to Irish Fiction</i>
published in 1910, and now out of print. The differences
may be reduced to four:—</p>

<p>(1). The number of books dealt with is almost double
that of the earlier work.</p>

<p>(2). The arrangement is quite new. In the former work
the books were classified according to subject matter: in this
they are arranged under the names of the Authors, these names
being arranged alphabetically. Some lists are appended in
which the books are classified as historical novels, Folk-lore,
Gaelic Epic and Romantic Literature, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(3). A combined title and subject index has been provided,
both of which were lacking in the earlier book. Some new
matter is given in the Appendix, in particular some notes on
fiction in Irish periodicals.</p>

<p>(4). In <i>A Reader’s Guide</i>, &amp;c., a few notes on Authors
were added at the end. In the present work biographical
notes on a large proportion of the Authors are given immediately
before the notes on their books.</p>

<p>Apart from these differences, the two works have the
same scope and aim. In both, the scope includes all works
of fiction published in volume form, and dealing with Ireland
or with the Irish abroad, and such works only. The present
book, therefore, is not, any more than was the earlier book, a
guide to the works of Irish novelists—else, Goldsmith, for
instance, might surely claim a place. Neither is it, properly
speaking, a book of advice as to what is best to read. The
aim has been to provide descriptive notes of an <i>objective</i>
nature, to record facts, not to set forth personal views and
predilections. This is a book of reference pure and simple;
it neither condemns nor recommends. In this respect it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
differs from several other guides to fiction which at first sight
it seems to resemble. The Abbé Bethléem’s most valuable
<i>Romans à lire et romans à proscrire</i> has been mentioned in the
former preface. Its title proclaims its character. Of a
similar nature are some works by members of my own Order
that have since come to my knowledge. It will be useful
to record their titles:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">1. P. Gerardo Decorme, S.J.—Lecturas recomendables.
(Barcelona: Luis Gili). 1908.</p>

<p class="hanging">2. P. Pablo Ladron de Guevara, S.J.—Novelistas malos
y buenos. Pp. 523. (Bilbao). 1910.</p>

<p class="hanging">4. Guide de Lecture. (Brussels). Second ed., 1912.
A magnificent 4to volume of 1032 pp., compiled
by a Belgian Jesuit, Fr. Schmidt, and constituting
the catalogue of his great Bibliothèque
Choisie of 200,000 volumes.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">No. 1 devotes only a chapter to fiction. No. 2 contains a
critical examination from a moral point of view of 413 Spanish
writers, 1,220 French, 150 English, 98 German, as well as
Russian, Belgian, &amp;c. No. 3 devotes a section to <i>Schöne
Literatur</i> giving notes and bibliographical details. Symbols
are used to indicate the suitability of the books to readers of
various ages. The same plan is followed in No. 4, but to a
much fuller extent, and the whole work is on a larger scale.</p>

<p>Enough has been said, I think, in the former preface as
to the object aimed at in the notes. I have tried to make that
object clear: I am far from thinking that it has always been
attained, even in this revised work. Some of the excuses for
incompleteness that held good for the first steps into an almost
untrodden field have no doubt ceased to have the same force.
I have had time to explore new ground, and to survey anew
that already occupied. On the other hand the years that
have slipped away since the former book have been filled by
many duties that left little time for literary work. Yet,
though I am unable to say with confidence that this work is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
bibliographically exhaustive, I trust that, for practical purposes,
for the purposes for which it is intended, it may be
found reasonably complete. For the achievement of even
this result I can by no means claim all the credit. My
obligations to my numerous helpers are very great indeed, as
will appear from the Acknowledgements.</p>

<p>One further point needs to be dwelt upon—the non-inclusion
of works of fiction written in the Irish language. I
cannot do better in this connection than quote from the preface
to a former work<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in which this same point came up for explanation:—“I
have not included books in the Irish language.
My reasons for this are threefold. In the first place my own
knowledge of Irish is not yet sufficient to enable me even to
edit satisfactorily notes of books in Irish.... In the
second place I do not think that a bibliography of works in
Irish should be made a mere appendage or sub-section, as it
would inevitably be, of a work such as the present. Lastly,
it may well be doubted whether the time be yet come for doing
this work in the way that it deserves to be done.” This last
reason is partly based on the fact of the great mass of Irish
literature still remaining in MS., a quantity probably much
greater than what has been printed and published. The publication
of the National Library’s bibliography is mentioned
in the Appendix on Gaelic literature as an additional reason for
my omission of books in Irish.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the omission of books in the Irish language
from a Guide to Irish Fiction remains an anomaly, one of the
many anomalies produced by the historic causes that have all
but destroyed the Irish language as the living speech of
Ireland.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE_TO_A_READERS_GUIDE_TO">PREFACE TO A READERS GUIDE TO
IRISH FICTION (1910).</h2>

</div>

<p>The present <span class="smcap">Guide to Irish Fiction</span> is intended by the
Author as the first part of a work in which it is hoped to
furnish notes on books of all kinds dealing with Irish subjects.</p>

<p>Before explaining the scope of this section of the work
it may be well, in order to forestall wrong impressions, to
say at once what it is <i>not</i>. In the first place, then, it does
not lay claim to be a bibliography. By this I do not mean
that I am content to be inaccurate or haphazard, but simply
that I do not aim at exhaustive completeness. In the second
place, it is not a catalogue of books <i>by Irish writers</i>. Lastly,
it does not deal exclusively with books printed or published in
Ireland.</p>

<p>The Author’s aim has been to get together and to print
in a convenient form a classified list of novels, tales, &amp;c.
(whether by Irish or by foreign writers), bearing on Ireland—that
is, depicting some phase of Irish life or some episode of
Irish history—and to append to each title a short descriptive
note.</p>

<p>Two things here call for some explanation, viz., the list
of titles and the descriptive notes.</p>

<p>As to the former, I have, with some trifling exceptions,
included everything that I have been able to discover, provided
it came within the scope of the work, as indicated above.
It has been thought well to do this, because a vast amount of
fiction that, from an artistic or from any other point of view,
is defective in itself may yet be valuable as a storehouse of
suggestion, fact, and fancy for later and better writers. For
was it not worthless old tales and scraps of half-mythical
history that held the germs of “Hamlet” and “Macbeth,”
“King Lear” and “Othello”? There remains, indeed a
large class of novels and tales that, so far as one may judge, can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
serve no useful purpose. It may be thought that with such
books the best course to pursue is to allow them to pass into
merited oblivion. But it must be remembered that booksellers
and publishers will naturally continue to push such
books because it is their business to do so, and the public
will continue to buy them because it has ordinarily no other
means of knowing their contents than the publisher’s announcement,
the title, or—the cover. A “Guide” would, therefore,
surely shirk an important portion of its task if it excluded
worthless books, and thereby failed to put readers on their
guard.</p>

<p>Next, as regards the descriptive notes: there are three
points which I should wish to make clear—the source of
the information contained in these notes; their scope, that
is, the nature and extent of the information with which they
purpose to furnish the reader; and, thirdly, the tone aimed
at throughout the work.</p>

<p>Information about the books has been obtained in various
ways. A considerable number have been read by the Author.
Indeed, there are few writers of note included in the Guide
about whose works he cannot speak from first-hand knowledge.
Of the books that remain the great majority have been
specially read for this work by friends, and a full account of
the same written by them according to a formula drawn up
for the purpose. In all cases, except in a very few—and
these have been indicated—the wording of the final note is
mine. In the few cases referred to, printed reviews or notices
of the books have been drawn upon, the source of the note
being mentioned in each instance.</p>

<p>A word about the <i>scope</i> of the notes. My chief object
in undertaking this work was to help the student of things
Irish. This object determined the character of the notes.
A few years ago there appeared in France an excellent
work, entitled <i>Romans à lire et Romans à proscrire</i> (Cambrai:
Masson), by the Abbé Bethléem, which has since passed
through many editions. In this work novels are classed
<i>au point de vue moral</i>. In the rare cases in which the books<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
included in my list contain matter objectionable from a moral
or a religious standpoint, I have not hesitated to remark the
fact in the note. This was, however, but a small part of the
task. It will be clear likewise, from what has been said
that my object is not to attempt <i>literary</i> criticisms of Irish
fiction. Such literary appreciations are to be found in other
works already published, accounts of several of which will be
found in the Appendix. True, a certain amount of criticism
is often needed lest the account given of a book should be
misleading, but it has been avoided wherever it did not seem
to further the main purpose. This purpose, let me repeat, is,
above all, to give <i>information</i> to intending readers. I have,
therefore, endeavoured, as well as might be, in the small
space available, simply to give a clear idea of the contents of
the books. In a good many cases I have further attempted
an appreciation, or rather a characterization, of the book
in question, but this was not always possible nor, indeed,
necessary.</p>

<p>Of the tone adopted in these notes little need be said.
I did not consider that it would further my purpose to aim
at that literary flavour and epigrammatic turn of phrase
affected, and with reason, by reviewers in many periodicals.
Moreover, to do so would have been inconsistent with brevity.
Then, I must disclaim all intention of saying “clever” things
at the expense of any book, however low it may deserve
to be rated. I have endeavoured to avoid, too, the technicalities
of criticism. Lastly, I trust the little work has not
been rendered suspect to any class of Irishmen by the undue
intrusion of religious or political bias.</p>

<p>Apology might well be made here for the defects of the
work. They will, I fear, be but too evident. But it
should be borne in mind that, with the exception of Mr.
Baker’s works, to which I cannot sufficiently acknowledge
my indebtedness, I have had no guide upon the way, since no
writer, so far as I am aware, has hitherto dealt in this way
with Irish fiction as a whole.</p>

<p>It may be asked, for whom especially this book is meant?
In the first place, I hope it may be useful to the general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
reader who wishes to study Ireland. Next, it may help
in the important and not easy task of selection those who
have to buy books for any purpose, such as the giving of
presents, the conferring of prizes in school or out of it, the
stocking of shops and libraries—in other words, booksellers,
library committees, heads of schools and colleges, librarians,
pastors, and many others. Again, it may be of some service
to lecturers and to popular entertainers. I have some hopes,
too, that coming writers of Irish fiction, from seeing what has
been done and what has not yet been done, may get from it
some suggestions for future work. It may even help in a small
way towards the realization of a great work not yet attempted,
the writing of a history of Anglo-Irish literature.</p>

<p>My best thanks are due, in the first place, to the authorities
of Clongowes Wood College, without whose constant aid and
encouragement my task would have been impossible.</p>

<p>Next, I wish to thank those publishers who courteously
sent me copies of a number of their books, viz., the Irish
publishers, Messrs. Gill; Duffy; Sealy, Bryers and Walker;
Maunsel; and Blackie: and the London publishers, Messrs.
Macmillan; Nelson; Methuen; Dent; Chatto and Windus;
Burns and Oates; Sands; Blackwood; Nutt; Elliot Stock;
and Smith, Elder. I should like to give greater prominence
to the publications of these firms. The plan of this book
prevents me from doing so but I may say that this little
work, which will, I hope, help to make known their books,
could not have appeared but for their generosity.</p>

<p>To those who, as already mentioned, have aided in the
work by reading books, and supplying information about
them, my sincerest thanks are hereby tendered. I should
be glad, if it were possible, to express here my obligations
to each individually, but I must, for obvious reasons, limit
myself to this general acknowledgment. There are, however,
some whom, on account of special obligations on my
part, I shall have the pleasant task of thanking by name.
To Mr. E. A. Baker, <span class="allsmcap">M.A., D.LITT.</span>, Librarian of the Woolwich
Public Library, I am indebted both for kind permission
to quote from his books and for constant advice and
suggestion given with the greatest cordiality. To Dr.
Conor Maguire, of Claremorris, I owe most of my notes of
books on Irish Folk-lore, and to Mr. Edmund Downey, the
well-known author and publisher, notes on Lever’s books,
together with many useful suggestions. Mr. Francis J.
Bigger, <span class="allsmcap">M.R.I.A.</span>, of Belfast, the always ready and enthusiastic
helper of every Irish enterprise, has aided me with valuable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
advice and no less valuable encouragement. Mr. J. P.
Whelan, Librarian of the Kevin Street Public Library, Dublin,
has rendered me every assistance in his power. Dr. J. S.
Crone of London, Editor of the <i>Irish Book Lover</i>, has on
several occasions kindly opened to me the pages of his
periodical. Lastly, I must acknowledge here, with sincere
thanks, much help of various kinds given me by many members
of my own Order, and notably, Rev. M. Russell, <span class="allsmcap">S.J.</span>; Rev.
M. Corbett, <span class="allsmcap">S.J.</span>; Rev. P. J. Connolly, <span class="allsmcap">S.J.</span>, and the Rev.
J. F. X. O’Brien, <span class="allsmcap">S.J.</span>—the last of whom very kindly undertook
the tedious labour of revising my proofs.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<h3>[<i>Additional (Present Work).</i>]</h3>

<p>My obligations to my various kind helpers in the present work
are even greater than in the case of the former book, and I am
at a loss for an adequate expression of them. My thanks
have, of course, been privately conveyed, but there are some
collaborators who have had so large a share in the making of
this book that I cannot but place on record its indebtedness
towards them.</p>

<p>For valuable work in the British Museum Library extending
over a considerable length of time I have to thank
Mrs. Pearde Beaufort, Miss C. J. Hamilton, and Miss G. B.
Ryan. For much tedious labour in the rearrangement of the
matter contained in the earlier book, I am indebted to the
Misses Chenevix Trench (who also supplied many notes), and
to Mrs. O’Neill, of Dundalk. To Dr. Crone, whose readiness
to help when any Irish literary enterprise is afoot is inexhaustible,
I owe many corrections, suggestions, and additions,
and the laborious task of revising my MS. and correcting my
proofs. Mr. Edmund Downey, of Waterford, has kindly
read part of the proofs. Many books have been read for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
me and notes supplied by Lady Gilbert; Mrs. Concannon,
of Galway; Mrs. L. M. Stacpoole Kenny, of Limerick;
Miss J. F. Walsh, of Derry; Miss R. Young, of Galgorm
Castle, Co. Antrim; Mrs. Macken, of the National University;
Fr. MacDwyer, of Killybegs; and, perhaps most
of all, Fr. J. Rabbitte, <span class="allsmcap">S.J.</span>, of St. Ignatius College, Galway.
Mr. D. J. O’Donoghue, Librarian of the National University,
has given me many suggestions, as well as some useful notes
on fiction in Irish periodicals. Mr. Frank Macdonagh also
has been very helpful with notes and corrections. I owe
likewise a debt of gratitude to the authorities and the staff of
the National Library for their courtesy and helpfulness. Nor
must I omit a word of thanks to the publishers (including
all the Irish publishers, and Messrs. Flynn, of Boston), who,
as on a former occasion, made my task much lighter by
supplying me with review copies of their books.</p>

<p>Lastly to all the others, and they are many, who have
in various ways given me help my very sincere thanks are
hereby tendered.</p>

<p>For the matter contained in my notes on the Authors, I
am much indebted to Mr. D. J. O’Donoghue’s <i>Poets of Ireland</i>,
and to the pages of the <span class="smcap">Irish Book Lover</span>.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ ADVENTURER, THE.</p>

<p>In Mitchel’s <i>Life of Hugh O’Neill</i> there is a note in reference to his wooing
of Sir Henry Bagenal’s sister, stating that a novel was published founded
on this story, and entitled <i>The Adventurer</i>. (Query in I.B.L., vol. iv., p. 161.)
This book does not seem to be in the British Museum Library, but I have
found in an old catalogue a book with the title “The Adventurers; or,
Scenes in Ireland in the Reign of Elizabeth, 1825.” This is probably the book
referred to by Mitchel.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ ADVENTURES OF FELIX AND ROSARITO, THE; or, The Triumph
of Love and Friendship. Pp. 58. (Title-p. missing). 1802.</p>

<p>The hero is one Felix Dillon. Though the story begins and ends in Dublin,
its scene is chiefly France, and afterwards Spain.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ ALBION AND IERNE: A Political Romance; by “An Officer.”
Pp. 192. (<i>Marcus Ward</i>). 1886.</p>

<p>An allegory in which the personages stand for countries and institutions.
Ierne is of course Ireland, Albion is England. Then there are minor
characters, such as Dash, Dupe, Plan, Sacrifice. Under this form the
relations between the two countries and the possible results of separation
are exhibited. Ends with the happy marriage of Albion with Kathleen,
Ierne’s sister, and the burial of the hereditary feud.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ BALLYBLUNDER: an Irish story. Pp. 291. (<span class="smcap">London</span>: <i>Parker</i>).
1860.</p>

<p>Scene: the N.E. coast of Ireland, with its rugged rocks and lofty cliffs.
The plot concerns the kindly family of “Ballyblunder,” on whose estate
sheep are constantly being killed. A priest instigates to the crime, and
encourages the perpetrators. Mr. Kindly’s son goes out to track the sheep-killers;
a friend of his is murdered, and Brady, the murderer, falls off a cliff
and is killed. The Kindlys eventually sell the estate. Some social scenes
are interspersed. Written in a spirit of religious intolerance.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ BALLYRONAN.</p>

<p>“A wonderfully interesting story, written in an easy, rattling style, with
cleverly conceived plot, abundant humour, and no lack of incident. There
is an unmistakably Irish atmosphere about it, and it bespeaks an intimate
personal knowledge of the people, not only in regard to their speech, but also
as to many of their characteristic ways and customs.”—(<i>Press Notices</i>).</p>

<p class="book">⸺ BLACK MONDAY INSURRECTION. Pp. 135-328.</p>

<p>Bound up with “The Puritan,” <i>q.v.</i> The story opens at Bandon with
the rescue of two of the principal characters who had been kidnapped by
Rapparees. Then follows the taking of Bandon by McCarthy More. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
battles of the Boyne and Aughrim, the sieges of Athlone and Limerick are also
dealt with, the two latter being described in detail. Standpoint: Williamite.
The Irish are “barbarians,” “brave and savage bacchanalians;” the Rapparees
are “infernal banditti,” &amp;c., but on the whole the tone is not violent.
Through it all runs an interesting and curious story of the private fortunes of
several persons. See <i>The Last of the O’Mahonys</i>.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ BOB NORBERRY; or, Sketches from the Note Book of an Irish Reporter;
ed. by “Captain Prout.” Pp. 360. Eighteen good illustr. by Henry
MacManus, <span class="allsmcap">A.R.H.A.</span>, and others. Dedicated to C. Bianconi. (<i>Duffy</i>).
1844.</p>

<p>The Author (Pref.) tells us that he has written the book to vindicate the
character of his countrymen, and to show Irish affairs to Englishmen in their
true light. Accordingly we have, not so much a novel, as a series of crowded
canvases depicting nearly every phase of life in Ireland from a period before
the Union to the date of this book. It begins with the marriage of the hero’s
grandparents in Dublin at the end of the 18th century (1780). We have a
glimpse of penal laws at work and of agrarian disturbances, but the Author
is especially at pains all through the book to set forth how the law works in
Ireland. There are swindling attorneys, bribed and perjured jurors, packed
benches, partisan judges, endless proceedings in Chancery, and so on. Young
Bob is sent first to a private school, then to Stonyhurst (an account is given
of the Jesuits). He is first intended for the priesthood and goes to Louvain,
but finally becomes a reporter on a Dublin paper. Here we have a picture
of low journalism. Bob shows up several frauds of self-styled philanthropists,
describes trial at Assizes of Lord Strangeways’ evicted tenants. This brings
in much about the agrarian question. The book ends with his elopement to
the Continent and marriage with Lady Mary Belmullet. There are
innumerable minor episodes and pictures. There is no literary refinement in
the style, and the colours of the picture are laid on thickly.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ BRIDGET SULLIVAN; or, The Cup without a Handle. A Tale. 1854.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ BY THE BROWN BOG; by “Owen Roe and Honor Urse.” Pp. 296.
(<i>Longmans</i>). Illustr. by silhouettes. 1913.</p>

<p>An imitation of the Somerville and Ross stories, but with their leading
features exaggerated. For Flurry we have Fossy, for Slipper Tinsy Conroy.
Instead of by an R.M. the stories are told by a young D.I. There is the same
background of comic and filthy peasants, the same general Irish slovenliness
and happy-go-luckiness, and universal drunkenness. The brogue is made
the most of. Moonlighters of a very sinister kind appear once or twice.
The incidents are such as hunting, racing, the local horseshow, country petty
sessions, &amp;c. They are very well told, with a jaunty style, and in a vein of
broad comedy. There is a chapter purporting to relate experiences in
“The Black North,” but for the most part the scene is West Cork. Some of
these sketches appeared in the <span class="smcap">Badminton Magazine</span>.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ BYRNES OF GLENGOULAH, THE. Pp. 362. (U.S.A.)</p>

<p>“The incidents related in this tale really and truly occurred, though not in
the consecutive order in which they are placed” ... viz., “the
trial and execution, in February, 1846, at the town of Mullingar, Co. Westmeath,
of Bryan Seery for the murder of Sir Francis Hopkins, Bart.” “The
characters introduced are all real.” (Pref.) A sad and touching story of the
heartless treatment of the Irish peasantry by certain of the landlords, picturing
the deep religious faith of the former, and their patient resignation in their
sufferings. The plot, which is vigorously worked out, centres in the execution
of Bryan Seery for the attempted murder of Sir Francis Hopkins, a crime of
which he was innocent.</p>

Stealers,” “Owen McCarthy,” “Squire Warnock,” “The Abduction,” “Sir
Turlough.” II. By Lover:—“A Legend of Clanmacnoise” (<i>sic</i>), “Ballads

<p>By the author of “The Widow O’Leary.” Dr. B., whose parents live at Y.
(probably Youghal), has a practice in England. He is challenged to fight a
duel by Sir J. C. He is killed, and his parents both die from the shock.
A dull little book, with much moralising.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ COLONEL ORMSBY; or, the genuine history of an Irish nobleman
in the French service. Two Vols. (<span class="smcap">Dublin</span>). 1781.</p>

<p>In form of letters between the Colonel and Lady Beaumont, couched in the
most amatory terms. There is no reference to Ireland and little to the history
of the gallant Colonel: the correspondence is all about the private love affairs
of the writers.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ DUNSANY: an Irish Story. Two Vols. 12mo. Pp. 278 + 308.
(<span class="smcap">London.</span>) 1818.</p>

<p>The principal character and a few of the others, <i>e.g.</i>, Mrs. Shady
O’Blarney (!), happen to be born in Ireland, and there is talk of the usual
tumbled-down castle somewhere in Ireland, but at this the Irishism of the
story stops. The scene is England, the persons wholly English in sympathy
and education. A sentimental and insipid story dealing chiefly with the
marrying off of impecunious sons and daughters. Interesting as giving a
picture, seen from an English standpoint, of the Irish society of the day.
No politics.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ EDMOND OF LATERAGH: a novel founded on facts. Two vols.
(<span class="smcap">Dublin</span>). 1806.</p>

<p>Two lovers kept apart by cruel circumstances and villainous plots meet
at last and are happy. This thread serves to connect many minor plots,
which bring us from Ireland (near Killarney) to England and then the
continent and back again, and introduce a great variety of personages. These
latter are nearly all of the Anglo-Irish Protestant gentry—Wharton, Wandesford,
Peyton, Ulverton, Blackwood, Elton—no Irish name is mentioned.
Great profusion of incident, but not very interestingly told. No historical
or social background. Relates rather a large number of instances of misconduct.
Speaks of “paraphernalia of Popish doctrine,” yet one of the
best characters is Father Issidore (<i>sic</i>).</p>

<p class="book">⸺ EDMUND O’HARA: an Irish Tale. Pp. 358. (<span class="smcap">Dublin</span>: <i>Curry</i>). 1828.</p>

<p>By the author of “Ellmer Castle.” A controversial story of an anti-Catholic
kind. The hero goes to Spain to be educated for the priesthood.
He meets Hamilton, who indoctrinates him with Protestantism. They are
wrecked off the Irish coast. A priest refuses them the money to take them
home to the North of Ireland, while the Protestants generously give it. He
falls in love with Miss Williams, who insists on a year’s probation so that he
may be sufficiently “adorned with Christian graces.” But he dies, and she
marries Hamilton.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ ELLMER CASTLE. Pp. 320. (<span class="smcap">Dublin</span>: <i>Curry</i>). 1827.</p>

<p>By the author of “Edmund O’Hara,” <i>q.v.</i> Henry Ellmer travels, and
comes back converted to convert his family. He causes only anger and
disturbance. They turn him out, and he departs with a blessing. But
after some adventures returns to his father’s deathbed. Contains much
controversial matter.</p>

Compiled from approved sources.”</p>

<p class="book">⸺ FATHER BUTLER; or, Sketches of Irish Manners. 16mo. (<span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>).
1834.</p>

<p>I am not sure whether this is the American edition of a little Souper tract
by Carleton (<i>q.v.</i>) published by Curry in 1829, in which Father Butler finally
is convinced of the falsity of his religion and becomes a Protestant.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ FATHER JOHN; or, Cromwell in Ireland (1649); by “S. E. A.”
Pp. 477. (<i>Whittaker</i>, later <i>Gill</i>). Still reprinted. [1842].</p>

<p>A well told story, with a love interest and a mystery admirably sustained
to the end. The plot largely turns on the misfortunes and sufferings brought
about by Father John’s fidelity to the secrecy of the confessional, a fidelity
which the author strongly condemns. The hero is a young Irish Protestant,
who before the close of the story has converted to his faith such of the Catholic
personages of the tale as do not rank as villains. The moral of the story is
the iniquity and falseness of the Catholic religion, for which the author
throughout displays a very genuine horror. The author’s political sympathies
are Ormondist, but Owen Roe O’Neill is favourably described. The massacres
of Drogheda and Wexford are described. It is “by the Author of ‘The
Luddite’s Sister,’ ‘Richard of York,’” &amp;c.</p>

very sympathetic towards Ireland and anti-Orange. No religious bias. A
pathetic and a dramatic story.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ FRANK O’MEARA; or, The Artist of Collingwood; by “T. M.”
Pp. 320. (<span class="smcap">Dublin</span>: <i>McGlashan &amp; Gill</i>). 1876.</p>

<p>Frank, of the tenant class, falls in love with the landlord’s daughter, Fanny.
Their love is discovered, and Frank finds it best to emigrate to Australia.
Here he has various adventures—bush-rangers, gold-diggings, and so on. A
comic element is afforded by the sayings and doings of his man, Jerry Doolin.
Meanwhile F’s father and his friend, another widower, contend for the
favours of the widow Daly—rather broad comedy—while Fanny, without
losing her place in society, is running a bookshop while waiting for Frank.
All is well in the end. A very pleasant story in every respect. “Collingwood”
is a village near Melbourne. Part of the story takes place at Bray.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ GERALD AND AUGUSTA; or, The Irish Aristocracy. Pp. 320.
(<i>Cameron &amp; Ferguson</i>). 6<i>d.</i> paper.</p>

<p>How Gerald, orphan son of Lord Clangore, is brought up in London to be
anti-Irish, while his sister is brought up by a Mr. Knightly (a stay-at-home
Irish squire absorbed in Ireland) to love Ireland. How chance brings Gerald
to Ireland where he is quite won over to her cause. This chance is a wreck
off the W. coast of Ireland resulting in Gerald’s falling temporarily into the
hands of “Captain Rock.” Many amusing adventures and situations follow.
The author’s sympathies are all for Ireland, but they are not blind or unreasoned
sympathies. Very ably written both in style and construction.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ HAMPER OF HUMOUR, A; by Liam. Pp. 176. (<i>Gill</i>). 2<i>s.</i> 1913.</p>

<p>A series of character and <i>genre</i> studies—the shy man, the drunken driver
who wakes to find himself in a hearse and thinks it is his own funeral, the
returned American, the magistrates who do a good turn for their friends.
In this last and in several other sketches (notably in the two concerned with
Cork railways) there is a note of satire. There is plenty of genuine humour
to justify the title. The Cork accent is cleverly hit off; practically all the
sketches are more or less Corkonian.</p>

<p>“A selection [thirty-five in all] of the most popular Irish tales, anecdotes,

in the filthiest and most disgusting conditions. She is found in a barn and
taken in by kindly English people, and after a little management becomes a
Protestant at the age of fourteen, and indeed quite a theologian in her way.
A visit to a church in Cork and to Ardman, near Youghal, where the dust of
St. Dillon is sold by the bushel for miracle purposes, completes her conversion.
The book is full of the vilest slanders against the Catholic Church. The Irish

Irwin, Lefanu, Lynam, Coyne, Sullivan by one each. Practically all the

<p>Begins in Dublin, the teller being a Dublin lawyer, but nearly all the incidents
take place out of Ireland. All the personages are more or less disreputable,
including the teller, but especially the hero, Helgate, who is a

a drunken, swindling wretch, who deceives foolish people and lives on them.

255. (<span class="smcap">London</span>: <i>Ridgway</i>). 1847.</p>

<p>The dedication (to O’Connell) is dated 1834, and the first words of the book
are “In the summer of 1833....” A very eccentric book, intended by
the Author (a lady) as a satire on the “fashionable depravities of the times,”
with intent to “exhibit folly and vice to public scorn and reproach.” (Pref.).
She is out against proselytism, bigotry, hypocrisy, aristocracy, race-hatred
between Ireland and England, and all abuses that bear heavily on the people.
This book consists of various parts:—I. “The Sojourner in Dublin”—a
young Englishman who lives in lodgings and tells what he sees and hears.
II. “The Modern Pharisees of the city of Shim-Sham in Ireland,” in the
form of a story. III. “Life in the Irish Militia”—a fierce attack on the
militia, especially a Northern and a Kerry regiment. IV. “A Visit to
Killarney.” V. An Allegorical Tale.</p>

<p>The hero is “a day labourer reared in the R.C. communion but through

by the priest and assaulted by the parishioners. These are prosecuted, but
the only result is moonlighting, murder, and the kidnapping of converts.
Yet the converts multiply. The reproduction of the brogue is ludicrous.

Leinster, Lady Rossmore, Mr. Justice Fletcher, Alderman M’Kenny, &amp;c.
The hero goes to the U.S. and then to S. America. The title of the tale
seems to be due to his meeting various peoples—Greeks, Argentiners, Chilians,

Three Vols. (<span class="smcap">London</span>: <i>Newby</i>). 1853.</p>

<p>A somewhat ordinary tale of the fortunes of young Charles Desmond, an
army officer, is made the vehicle for a careful and detailed picture of manners
and customs at the period, and for a presentation of the Author’s views on
things Irish, though with little reference to politics or to religion. The plot,
such as it is, turns chiefly on the question whether Charles will come in for
his old uncle’s money and will, in spite of whispering tongues, marry the lady—both
of which he does. The conversation of some of the personages is full
of pedantry and of quotations in various languages. Dublin life well portrayed

“Lotus,” etc. Three Vols. (<span class="smcap">London</span>: <i>Eden, Remington</i>). 1891.</p>

<p>“Lotus” is by I. M. O. A book inspired by the bitterest dislike and
contempt for Ireland. The views expressed by the young English soldier
(p. 101) seem throughout to be those of the author. The interest turns almost
entirely on the relations between landlord, tenant, and League, and no effort
is spared to represent the two latter in the most odious light. It is the work of
a practised writer, and the descriptions are distinctly good and the story
well told. The brogue is painfully travestied. The author is ignorant of
Catholic matters.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ PROTESTANT RECTOR, THE. Pp. 216. (<i>Nesbit</i>). 1830.</p>

<p>At the hospitable Protestant rectory even the priest is received. This
priest “performed several masses on Sundays”: he is frequently drunk.
He goes to Rome and, at the “fearful sight” of the Pope treated as God, he
recoils in disgust, and is converted. On his return he is again welcomed at
the Rectory, where he converts many and dies a holy death.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ PURITAN, THE. Pp. 134.</p>

<p>The interest of this story turns chiefly on the religious differences of the
times. The author is for “the calm and rational service of the Church of
England” as against the new fanaticism of the Parliamentarians. The
characters, such as those of Obadiah Thoroughgood and Lovegrace, are
well-drawn. There is but little local colour and no description of scenery.
The scene is laid at Bandon, Co. Cork. Bound up in one vol. with “Black
Monday Insurrection,” <i>q.v.</i>, being Vol. III. of <i>The Last of The O’Mahonys</i>.</p>

Introd. (pp. xx. close print) gives a view of Irish history and politics from a
bitterly anti-English point of view. England has been “a traitor, a perjurer,
a robber, and an assassin throughout the whole of her infamous career.”
Append. gives in 5 pp. an “Authentic Report” of the invasion of Canada,
Fenianism is fully discussed, especially in ch. vi. Career of Gen. O’Neill,
ch. vii. A love story of an ordinary kind is used as a medium for politics and
historical narrative.</p>

<p>Scene chiefly Dublin Castle. Cromwellian cruelties under Ludlow depicted,
and early years of Restoration. The Robber Chieftain is Redmond O’Hanlon,
the Rapparee. The Ven. Oliver Plunket is also one of the characters. Some
incidents suggest Catholic standpoint, but in places the book reads like a
non-Catholic (though not anti-Catholic) tract. The hero and heroine are
Protestant. Full of sensational incidents, duels, waylayings by robber bands,
law court scenes, tavern brawls. Also many repulsive scenes of drunkenness
among the native Irish, and of murder, wild vengeance, and villainy of
all kinds. Hardly suitable for young people.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ SAINT PATRICK: a National Tale of the Fifth Century; by “An

<p>A romance of love and vengeance and druidical mysteries into which
St. Patrick enters as one of the <i>dramatis personæ</i>. There are plenty of exciting
incidents, some fine scenes, and a very good picture of druidism in the fifth
century. Very well written but for the unfortunate introduction of modern
Irish brogue and Scotch dialect. The religious point of view is Church of

love with Lady Kitty, who is in love with somebody else. Sir Roger tries to
get the latter into disreputable situations. They fight a duel, and the curtain

She is disowned by her parents but befriended and sheltered by Bet Fagan, a

book is a quite good attempt to relate the rebellion of Silken Thomas in a

<p>A tale of the Williamite wars. Dermot Lisronan vows vengeance on the
brutal Dutchman who has driven him from his ancestral home and been the
death of his mother. The book is the story of that vengeance. Dermot by
a strange fatality marries the daughter of this Dutchman, and some fine
psychological and human interest is afforded by the struggle in her mind
between love (the love of Dermot’s once bosom friend Fitz Ulick) and wifely
duty. The book is full of exciting and dramatic incidents and situations,
and never flags from the lurid beginning to the tragic close. The characters
are clearly drawn and they are worth drawing:—Bartley, the Hedge-schoolmaster;
Taaffe, the besotted coward, sorry product of Williamite rule;
Father Talbot, the devoted priest of penal days; Barry Fitz Ulick, a kind
of Sir Launcelot, and the rest. William III. is painted in darkest colours,
and the penal days that he inaugurated are shown in their full horror, though
as an offset to this we have a picture of the persecution of Huguenots in
France.</p>

<p>Dedication: To Caitlín ni Houlihan. A stirring and vivid romance of
Jacobite days (18th century) in Ireland, containing some intensely dramatic
episodes, <i>e.g.</i>, the escape of Prince Charles Edward. There are many threads
in the narrative, but the chief interest, perhaps, centres in a Jacobite who,
having served the cause well for twenty years, finds himself confronted with
the spectre of physical cowardice. To save the cause from disgrace, his
cousin Denis takes his place on the scaffold. The girl marries Clavering for
the same reason, not for love. The author interrupts her narrative at times
to express her views on Celticism (for which she is enthusiastic), religious
persecution, and modern degeneracy.</p>

Irishman who has Dutchified his name and turned Protestant), who has
followed her brother to rescue him from the designs of a hated kinsman.
She falls in love with Maurice de Saxe (of whom a careful and vivid portrait
is drawn), and the story of this “friendship” takes up much of the book.
She refuses him in the end, and marries the hated kinsman. A fine plot, full

are vividly described.</p>

his children by an Italian wife, his French sister-in-law, a band of gypsies of a
higher type, whose king is Louis XVII. of France, rescued from his persecutors
of the Terror and half-ignorant of his origin. These are some of the personages
of the tale. It is noteworthy that not one of the characters has a drop
of English blood. I shall not give the plot of the story. The last portion
is full of the highest moral beauty. The lad Enrique or Mudo, son of Henry
M’Morrogh (whose mother was an Italian) and of a Spanish gypsy princess,
is a wonderful conception. When the Author speaks, as he does constantly,
of things Catholic (notably the religious life and the Blessed Sacrament) he
does so not only correctly but in a reverential and understanding spirit.
The one exception is the character of Father O’Herlihy, which is offensive
to Catholic feeling, and unnatural. The moral tone throughout is high.
One of the episodes is the seduction of a peasant girl, but it is dealt with
delicately and without suggestiveness.</p>

resemblance to one another in style and in the treatment of their material;
but the work of John is often gloomy and tragic; that of Michael has
more humour, and is brighter. They have both a tendency to be melodramatic,
and can picture well savage and turbulent passion. They
have little lightness of humour or literary delicacy of touch, but they
often write with vigour and great realistic power. The object with
which the “O’Hara” Tales were written is thus stated by Michael
Banim: “To insinuate, through fiction, the causes of Irish discontent
and insinuate also that if crime were consequent on discontent, it was
no great wonder; the conclusion to be arrived at by the reader, not by
insisting on it on the part of the Author, but from sympathy with the
criminals.”</p>

<p>In this great novel, which is closely modelled on Scott, scene after scene
of the great drama of the Williamite Wars passes before the reader. Every
detail of scenery and costume is carefully reproduced. Great historical
personages mingle in the action. The two rival kings with all their chief
generals are represented with remarkable vividness. Then there are Sarsfield
and Rev. George Walker, Galloping O’Hogan the Rapparee, Carolan the bard,
and many others. The politics and other burning questions of the day are
thrashed out in the conversations. The intervals of the great historical
events are filled by the adventures of the fictitious characters, exciting to
the verge of sensationalism, finely told, though the <i>deus ex machina</i> is rather
frequently called in, and the dialogue is somewhat old-fashioned. The wild
scenery of the Antrim coast is very fully described, also the scenes through
which Sarsfield passed on his famous ride. The standpoint is Catholic and
Jacobite, but great efforts are made to secure historical fairness. The book
ends with the Treaty of Limerick.</p>

Vols. (<i>Colburn</i>). [1828]. Republ. in one volume by Duffy in 1865
under title <i>Lord Clangore</i>.</p>

<p>Opens in London. Several members of Anglo-Irish Society are introduced—the
Minister (Castlereagh) and the Secretary (Wilson Croker). There are
long disquisitions on Emancipation, the conversion of the peasantry, &amp;c.
Gerald Blount, younger son of an Irish peer, has all the anti-Irish bias of this
set. Flying after a duel he reaches Ireland, where he has many exciting
adventures with the Rockites. Finally he succeeds to the title and settles
down. The “double” (or mistaken identity) plays a part in this story, as in
so many of Banim’s. A meeting of the Catholic Association with O’Connell
and Shiel debating is finely described, also a Dublin dinner-party, at which
Scott’s son appears. The early part is somewhat tedious, but the later
scenes are powerful.</p>

<p>Deals with the fortunes of two Catholic families in the period immediately
following the Treaty of Limerick. Depicts their struggles to practise their
religion, and the vexations they had to undergo at the hands of hostile

1848.</p>

<p>Published anonymously. Preface tells us it was written some few years
before date of publication. Scene: City of Galway and Connemara (including
Aran). The main plot is concerned with the mystery surrounding the heir of
Ballymagawley, got out of the way in early childhood by the present owner,
Mr. Whaley, but returning in disguise to claim his rights. The interest is
threefold:—First, Mr. Whaley’s awful secret unknown to the daughter, whom
he loves with his whole soul, and who returns his love, and the desperate
efforts he makes to avert the revelation; 2nd, the study of character: Clara
Whaley, high-souled, intellectual, unworldly, scorning fashion and flirtation,
the astute worldly intellectual Hon. Augustus Foster, the empty-headed
Miss Fosters and so on; 3rd, a series of quite admirable and amusing vignettes
of the <i>petite bourgeoisie</i> of Galway—the vulgar and showy Mrs. Heffernan
with her absurd accent, the match-making Mrs. Flanagan (an inimitable
portrait), the mischief-making Peter Harry Joe, Considine the Butler, the
consequential Captain O’Connor, and the endless flirtations of the marriageable
young ladies. The peasantry are well drawn, but it is quite an outside view
of their life. The conversations are clever, but sometimes tediously long,
as are also the Author’s reflections.</p>

<p class="author"><b>BANIM, Michael.</b></p>

<p class="book">⸺ CROHOORE OF THE BILLHOOK. (<i>Duffy</i>). [1825].</p>

<p>Has been a very popular book. The action lies in one of the darkest
periods of Irish history, when the peasantry, crushed under tithe-proctor,
middleman, and Penal laws, retorted by the savage outrages of the secret
societies. One of these latter was the “Whiteboys,” with the doings of
which this book largely deals. The Author does not justify outrage, but
explains it by a picture of the conditions of which it was an outcome. A
dark and terrible story. The scene is Kilkenny and neighbourhood. It must
be added that most of the characters savour strongly of what is now known
as the “stage Irishman.”</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE CROPPY. Pp. 420. (<i>Duffy</i>). 2<i>s.</i> Still reprinted. [1828].</p>

<p>Opens with a long and serious historical introduction. There follow
many pages of a love story of the better classes which is, perhaps, not very
convincing. Samples of the outrages by which the people were driven to
revolt are given. Then there are many scenes from the heart of the rebellion
itself, some of them acquired from conversation with eye-witnesses. The
attitude is that of a mild Nationalist, or rather Liberal, contemplating with
sorrow not unmixed with contempt the savage excesses of his misguided
countrymen. The rebellion is shown in its vulgarest and least romantic
aspect, and there are harrowing descriptions of rebel outrages on Vinegar
Hill and elsewhere. The one noble or even respectable character in the book,
Sir Thomas Hartley, is represented as in sympathy with constitutional
agitation, but utterly abhorring rebellion. The other chief actors in the
story are unattractive. They have no sympathy with the insurgents, and
the parts they play are connected merely accidentally with the rebellion.
There is much movement and spirit in the descriptive portions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE BIT O’ WRITING.</p>

<p>This is the title-story of a volume of stories. First published in London,
1838. It may be taken as typical of Michael Banim’s humour at his best.
It is a gem of story-telling, and, besides, a very close study of the ways and the
talk of the peasantry. The “ould admiral,” with his sailor’s lingo, is most
amusing. It was republished along with another story, <i>The Ace of Clubs</i>,
by Gill, in a little volume of the O’Connell Press Series, pp. 144, cloth, 6<i>d.</i>,
1886. The original volume, with twenty stories, is still published by Kenedy,
New York.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ FATHER CONNELL. Pp. 358. [1840].</p>

<p>The scene is Kilkenny. The hero is an Irish country priest. The character,
modelled strictly (see Pref.) on that of a priest well known to the author,
is one of the noblest in fiction. He is the ideal Irish priest, almost childlike
in simplicity, pious, lavishly charitable, meek and long-suffering, but terrible
when circumstances roused him to action. Interwoven with his life-story
is that of Neddy Fennell, his orphan protégé, brave, honest, generous, loyal.
Father Connell is his ministering angel, warding off suffering and disaster,
saving him also from himself. The last scene, where, to save his protégé
from an unjust judicial sentence, Father Connell goes before the Viceroy, and
dies at his feet, is a piece of exquisite pathos. There is an element of the
sombre and the terrible. But the greater part of the book sparkles with a
humour at once so kindly, so homely, and so delicate, that the reader comes
to love the Author so revealed. The episodes depict many aspects of Irish
life. The character-drawing is masterly, as the best critics have acknowledged.
There is Mrs. Molloy, Father Connell’s redoubtable housekeeper; Costigan,
the murderer and robber; Mary Cooney, the poor outcast and her mother,
the potato-beggar; and many more. The Author faithfully reproduces
the talk of the peasants, and enters into their point of view. Acknowledged
to be the most pleasing of the Banims’ novels.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE GHOST HUNTER AND HIS FAMILY. (<i>Simms &amp; M’Intyre</i>).
[1833]. 1852.</p>

<p>Still published by P. J. Kenedy, New York: 75 cents. An intricate plot
skilfully worked out, never flagging, and with a mystery admirably sustained
to the end. Gives curious glimpses of the life of the times (early nineteenth
century), as seen in a provincial town (Kilkenny). But the style often
offends against modern taste. The book soon turns to rather crude, if
exciting, melodrama. Moreover, though the Author is always on the side of
morality, there is too much about abduction, &amp;c., and too many references
to the loose morals of the day to make it suitable reading for certain classes.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE TOWN OF THE CASCADES. Two Vols. Pp. 283 + 283.

<p>Scene: sea-board town in West. A powerful story in which the chief
interest is a tragedy brought about by drink. The town seems to be Ennistymon,
Co. Clare. The characters belong to the peasant class, and of course
are drawn with thorough knowledge. The work could easily go in one not
very large volume.</p>

<p>Doings at Lisconnell, a poverty-stricken little hamlet, lost amidst a waste
of unlovely bogland. These sketches have been well described as “saturated
with the pathos of elementary tragedy.” Yet there is humour, too, and even
fun, as in the story of how the shebeeners tricked the police. The illustrated

<p>In this story the peasants only appear incidentally. The main characters
are Martin Kerrigan, a returned Irish-Australian; the invalid Lady O’Connor;
her son, Sir Ben; and her niece, Merle. The story is one of intense, almost
hopeless, sadness, yet it is ennobling in a high degree. It is full of exquisite

<p>A second series of Irish Idylls, showing the Author’s qualities in perhaps
a higher degree even than the first. A more exquisite story than “A Good
Turn” it would be hard to find. Throughout there is the most thorough
sympathy with the poor folk. The peasant dialect is never rendered so as
to appear vulgar or absurd. It is full of an endless variety of picturesqueness
and quaint turns. No problems are discussed, yet the all but impossibility
of life under landlordism is brought out (see p. 15). There are studies of
many types familiar in Irish country life—the tinkers; Mr. Polymathers,
the pedagogue (a most pathetic figure); Mad Bell, the crazy tramp; and
Con the “Quare One.” It should be noted that, though there is in Miss
Barlow’s stories much pathos, there is an entire absence of emotional gush.</p>

<p>Eight little stories reprinted from various magazines in a very dainty

<p>The first six of this collection of fifteen stories are tales of foreign lands—Arabia,
Greece, and others. The remainder deal with Irish peasant life. They
tell of the romance and pathos that is hidden in lives that seem most commonplace.
“The Field of the Frightful Beasts” is a pretty little story of childish

<p>Fourteen stories, some humorous, some pathetic, including some of the
author’s best work. There is the usual sympathetic insight into the eccentricities
and queernesses of the minds of the peasant class, but little about the
higher spiritual qualities of the people, for that is not the author’s province.
Among the most amusing of the sketches is that which tells the doings of a
young harum-scarum, the terror of his elders.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE FOUNDING OF FORTUNES. Pp. 335. (<i>Methuen</i>). 1<i>s.</i> Cloth.

<p>The tale of how Timothy Galvin, a ragged urchin living in a mud cabin
and remarkable only for general dishonesty and shrewd selfishness, is given
a start in life by an ill-gotten purse, and rises by his mother wit to wealth.
The study of the despicable character of the parvenu is clever and unsparing.
Other types are introduced, the landlord of the old type, and two reforming
landlords, who appear also in <i>Kerrigan’s Quality</i>. The book displays Jane
Barlow’s qualities to the full.</p>

<p>Seventeen stories up to the level of the author’s best, the usual vein of
quiet humour, the pathos that is never mawkish, the perfect accuracy of the
conversations, and the faithful portrayal of characteristics. The study in
“A Money-crop at Lisconnell,” of the struggle between the Widow M’Gurk’s
deep-rooted Celtic pride and her kind heart, is most amusing. As usual,
there are delightful portraits of children.</p>

<p>Chapter I., “Ourselves and Our Island,” gives the author’s thoughts about
Ireland, its outward aspect, the peculiarities of its social life, its soul. It
includes an exquisite pen-picture of Irish landscape beauty. The remaining
fourteen sketches are “chapters from the history of some Irish country
folk,” whom she describes as “social, pleasure-loving, keen-witted,” but
“prone to melancholy and mysticism.” The last sketch is a picture, almost
photographic in its fidelity, of a little out-of-the-way country town and its
neighbourhood. The illustrations are pretty, and the artist, who, unlike
many illustrators of Irish books, has evidently been in Ireland, has made a
great effort to include in his pictures as much local colour as possible. Yet
it seems to us that un-Irish traits often intrude themselves despite him.</p>

qualities, minute observation and depiction of curious aspects of character,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
snatches of clever picturesque conversation, an occasional vivid glimpse of
nature. But in this case the caste is made up of spiteful, petty, small-minded
and generally disagreeable personages. They are nearly all drawn from
the middle and upper classes in the South of Ireland, Protestant and Anglicized.
The snobbishness, petty jealousies, selfishness of some of these people is set
forth in a vein of satire. The incidents include an unusually tragic suicide.</p>

Indeed he is quite a little <i>deus ex machina</i>, or rather a good fairy in the affairs

started a great peat factory in Ireland, and it had prospered. This work is
wrecked by the same agency that ruins his private happiness. Throughout
the book the Author attacks all the cherished ideas of Irish Nationalism and
of the present Irish revival, and sets over against them the ideals of England
and his personal views. Much bitterness is shown against the priests of
Ireland. The scene-painting and the handling of situation and of narrative

miseries are feelingly depicted. Standpoint of a kind-hearted Englishwoman
who pities, but does not in the least understand Ireland.</p>

<p>Ireland in the eighteen forties. Abortive rising under one of the O’Byrnes
of Wicklow (<i>Le dernier Irlandais</i>). O’Connell looms in the background as
the opponent of all this. The rebellion, which at once fizzles out, is the result
of an insult to O’Byrne’s sister by a <i>roué</i> named Clinton. O’B. flies to
Cunnemara (<i>sic</i>) with Nelly Avondale, daughter of the landlord of Glendalough,
is besieged there in a fortress. Nelly returns to marry the above-mentioned
<i>roué</i> and O’B. flies. The Author is evidently not consciously hostile to
Ireland, but he is totally ignorant of it. The peasants are travestied. They
are all drunkards, slovenly, sly, mean, lawless. Some descriptions of scenery
in Wicklow and Connemara.</p>

<p>Bryan O’Meara, son of a poor Irish migratory labourer, is educated as a
gentleman by Sir Cecil Foxglove, of Denham, near Grantham, in gratitude
for the rescue of his child by Bryan’s father. Coming to man’s estate,
and being refused by the Baronet’s daughter he returns to his father’s people
at Athlone, where for some time he plays at being a farmer’s lad—and at
rebellion. But a fortunate chance puts great wealth into his hands, and he
returns to marry the Baronet’s daughter. Interesting glimpses of Catholic
life in penal days (the story opens in 1805) when Catholicism was at the
lowest ebb in England. The <span class="smcap">Dublin Review</span> says (1848, Vol. xxiv., p. 239):
“The hero is a pious pedant, a truculent fellow, and a self-conceited proser.
The story itself is purposeless; bitter in sentiment, and swamped in never-ending
small-talk.” The “small-talk,” however is, if anything, over-serious
and moral.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE SEETHING POT. Pp. 299. (<i>Arnold</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1904.</p>

<p>Main theme: the apparently hopeless embroilment of politics and ideas in
Ireland. Many aspects of Irish questions and conditions of life are dealt with.
Many of the characters are types of contemporary Irish life, some are thinly
disguised portraits of contemporary Irishmen, <i>e.g.</i>, Dennis Browne, poet,
æsthete, egoist; Desmond O’Hara, journalistic freelance (said to be modelled
on Standish O’Grady); Sir Gerald Geoghegan, nationalist landlord; John
O’Neill, the Irish leader, who is deserted by his party and ruined by clerical
influence; and many others. All this is woven into a romance with a love
interest and a good deal of incident.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ HYACINTH. (<i>Arnold</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1906.</p>

<p>An account, conveyed by means of a slight plot, of contemporary movements
and personages in Ireland. Most of these are satirized and even
caricatured, especially “Robeen” Convent, by which seemed to be meant
Foxford Mills, directed by the Sisters of Charity (see <span class="smcap">New Ireland Review</span>,
March, 1906). A grasping, unscrupulous selfishness is represented to be one
of the chief characteristics of the Catholic Church in Ireland.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE BAD TIMES. Pp. 312. (<i>Methuen</i>). 6<i>s.</i> [1907]. New
edition, 1<i>s.</i> 1914.</p>

<p>Period: chiefly Isaac Butt’s Home Rule movement. Stephen Butler,
representative of a landlord family of strong Nationalist sympathies, determines
to work for Ireland. He joins the Home Rule Party, but he hates
agrarian outrage, and so, through the Land League, becomes unpopular in
his district in spite of all he has done. The author introduces types of nearly
every class of men then influential in Ireland: a priest who favours and a
priest who opposes the new agrarian movement, an incurably narrow-minded
English R.M., an old Fenian, and so on. The impression one draws from the
whole is much the same as that of the <i>Seething Pot</i>. The Author’s views are
strongly National, and there is no bitter word against any class of Irishmen,
<i>except</i> the present Parliamentary Party.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ BENEDICT KAVANAGH. Pp. 324. (<i>Arnold</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1907.</p>

<p>Dedication in Irish. Foreword in which the Author states that by
“Robeen” Convent he did not intend Foxford (cf. <i>Hyacinth</i>). A criticism
of Irish political life, free from rancour, and from injustice to any particular
class of Irishmen, showing strong sympathy for the Gaelic League, and all it
stands for. The hero is left at the parting of the ways, with the choice
before him of “respectability” and ease, or work for Ireland. The book
should set people asking why is it that Irishmen—no matter what their creed
or politics—cannot work together for their common country?</p>

<p>Scene: Antrim; a few incidents of the rising woven into a thrilling and
powerful romance. Splendid portraits—the United Irishmen James Hope,
Felix Matier, and Micah Ward, the loyal Lord Dunseverick, chivalrous and
fearless, Finlay the Informer, and others. Vivid presentment of the feelings
and ideas of the time, without undue bias, yet enlisting all the reader’s
sympathies on the side of Ireland.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ SPANISH GOLD. (<i>Methuen</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1908. Cheap ed., 1<i>s.</i> (N.Y.:
<i>Doran</i>). 1.20.</p>

<p>A comedy of Irish life, full of the most amusing situations. Scene: a
lonely island off the coast of Connaught, in which treasure is hidden. The
action consists of the adventures of various people who come to the island—an
Irish chief secretary, a retired colonel, a baronet, a librarian, a Catholic
priest, and a Protestant curate. This last, the Rev. J. J. Meldon, is a most
original creation. There are touches of social satire throughout, but without
bitterness or offensiveness.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE SEARCH PARTY. Pp. 316. (<i>Methuen</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1909. (N.Y.:
<i>Doran</i>). 1.20.</p>

<p>“How a mad Anarchist made bombs in a lonely house on the west coast
of Ireland, and imprisoned the local doctor for fear lest he should reveal the
secret. Mr. Birmingham’s irresponsible gaiety and the knowledge of Irish
character revealed in his more serious fiction carry the farce along at a fine
pace.”—(<span class="smcap">Times Lit. Suppl.</span>).</p>

<p class="book">⸺ LALAGE’S LOVERS. Pp. 312. (<i>Methuen</i>). 6<i>s.</i> (N.Y.: <i>Doran</i>).
1.20. 1911.</p>

<p>The main idea—in so far as the book is serious—may be stated thus:—How
much can one young person (aetat 14 <i>sqq.</i>) of perfect candour and fearlessness
do to upset the peace of comfortable people, who are jogging along
in the ruts of convention and compromise. Lalage begins with her governess,
then tries the bench of bishops, but causes most consternation by disturbing
an election with her Association for the Suppression of Public Lying. The
whole is full of fun and laughter. L. has been well described as “an
especially enterprising and slangy schoolboy in skirts.”</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE MAJOR’S NIECE. Pp. 302. (<i>Smith, Elder</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1911.</p>

a grown-up niece, who turns out to be a naughty little girl of ten. Mr. Meldon
had made innumerable plans for the reception and treatment of the young
lady. How does he face the new situation? There are capital minor
characters—Doyle the hotel keeper, and Father MacCormack, and the housekeeper,
Mrs. O’Halloran.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE SIMPKINS PLOT. Pp. 384. (<i>Nelson</i>). 2<i>s.</i> net. (N.Y.:
<i>Doran</i>). 1.20. 1911.</p>

<p>Scene: “Ballymoy.” Problem: how to get rid of Simpkins, a meddlesome
busybody. The interest of the plot mainly turns on the amusing
manœuvres of Rev. J. J. Meldon (the hero of <i>Spanish Gold</i>) to marry Simpkins
to a mysterious “Miss King,” a lady supposed to be identical with a Mrs.
Lorimer, recently acquitted, against the opinion of the Judge, of the murder
of her husband. Full throughout of fun, clever talk, and deftly sketched
character study. Sabina Gallagher, Sir Gilbert Hawksby, and Major Kent
are all well done, and there is no mistaking the nationalities.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE INVIOLABLE SANCTUARY. Pp. 370. (<i>Nelson</i>). 2<i>s.</i> 1912.</p>

<p>How Frank Mannix comes for vacation to Rosnacree (in the wildest west
of Ireland) in all the glory and dignity of a Haileybury prefect. How, owing
to a sprained ankle, he is obliged to spend the time sailing in the bay with
Priscilla, his fifteen-year-old madcap cousin. How various exciting adventures
follow, including the finding, in most unexpected and comical circumstances,
by a Cabinet Minister of his daughter, who had eloped with a clergyman,
and how Frank and Priscilla were responsible for the reconciliation.
Told with all the Author’s sense of fun and <i>flair</i> for comic situations. But
why must <i>all</i> Irish peasants appear as liars?</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE RED HAND OF ULSTER. Pp. 318. (<i>Smith, Elder</i>). 6<i>s.</i>
Cheap ed., 6<i>d.</i> 1912.</p>

<p>How an Irish-American millionaire runs a revolution in Ireland, sweeping
into his plans the rabid Orangemen, who are in deadly earnest, the Tory M.P.
who only meant to bluff, and members of the Irish Tory aristocracy who
meant nothing in particular. Of this class is poor Lord Kilmore, who tells
the story, and was an unwilling actor in the whole business. The book is a
mixture of shrewd satire (<i>e.g.</i>, Babberley, M.P., the Dean, and McConkey) in
which all parties receive their share, and of Gilbertian extravaganza. The
<i>dénouement</i> is both amusing and unexpected.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ DOCTOR WHITTY. Pp. 320. (<i>Methuen</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1913.</p>

<p>Types and humours of a west Connaught village—the P.P., the Protestant
Rector, Colonel Beresford, Thady Glynn, proprietor of “The Imperial Hotel,”
chairman of the League, and popular demagogue, J.P., general philosopher,
and “ipse dixit” of the village, and then the Doctor himself, genial, sociable,
“all things to all men” to an extent that gets him into fixes, and that is
not easily reconcilable with the moral order. There are broadly comical
situations from which the Doctor extricates himself, and emerges radiant as
ever. The seamy side of Irish life is depicted in the Author’s usual vein of
satire.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ GENERAL JOHN REGAN. Pp. 324. (<i>Hodder &amp; Stoughton</i>)
6<i>s.</i> Second ed., 1913.</p>

<p>A very slight plot, centering in the erection of a statue to an imaginary
native of Ballymoy. The real interest lies in the Author’s satirical
pictures of Irish life, and in his humorous delineations of such types as Dr.
O’Grady, Doyle the dishonest hotel-keeper, Major Kent, whom we have met in
<i>Spanish Gold</i>, Thady Gallagher, the editor of the local paper, and a rather
undignified and not wholly honest P.P. The thesis, if there be any, would
seem to be that the Irishman is so clever and humorous that he will allow
himself to be gulled, and will even gull himself for the pleasure of gulling
others.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ MINNIE’S BISHOP, and Other Stories of Ireland. Pp. 320. (<i>Hodder &amp;
Stoughton</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1915.</p>

<p>Not all of these stories deal with Ireland, and those that do are very varied
in character. Some are in the Author’s most humorous vein, others are more
serious in tone. In several he pokes fun at Government methods in the
West, and some show the comic side of gun-running, despatch-riding, and
other Volunteer activities. In the background, at times, is a vision of the
hopeless poverty of the Western peasant’s lot.</p>

handsome, proud of her ancient lineage and a poet, and Honor, plain and

<p>A tale of the unrequited love of an Irish girl of talent, but of humble
origin, for a selfish and ruffianly English author named Eugene Wolfe. She
falls in love with him as a child and then, in young womanhood, falls still
more deeply in love with the ideal of him which she forms from his books.
Nothing can kill or even daunt this love, and for its sake she undergoes the
supremest sacrifices, but all in vain. The two chief characters are carefully
and consistently drawn, and there are some dramatic scenes. The action
passes chiefly in London, whither Molly Carew had followed her ideal.</p>

<p>An account, in the form of a tale, of the Williamite Wars, from the landing of
James II. at Kinsale to the surrender of Galway, with all the battles and sieges
(except Derry). Into this is woven large sections of the family history of

<p>A dozen short stories, in which the village tailor recounts the exploits of

with Napoleon, the character of Malachi Neelin, the traitor: these and

<p class="book">⸺ THE BELFAST BOY. Pp. 464. (<i>Nutt</i>). 5<i>s.</i> 1912.</p>

<p>Opens in Belfast during the great riots of twenty-five years ago. The
hero, falsely accused of murder, flees to South Africa, where he becomes a
millionaire, and is known as “The Belfast Boy.” The heroine, when she is
going out to marry him, omits to mention that she is leaving a son and his
father (the villain) in Belfast. These are conveniently got rid of, one by
lightning, the other by lightning-like small-pox. Several real persons are
introduced as personages in the story. Many of the incidents are sensational,
there is much dialect, and the style in places is far from refined. An intense
love for Belfast and its surroundings pervades the book.—(<i>Press Notices</i>).</p>

<p>A story of landlord and tenant, of illicit distilling, and of proselytising.
A Bible reader, an agent, and the sister of a landlord are the villains of the
piece. Tone strongly Catholic and anti-Protestant. There is a love interest
and a certain amount of adventure, which are not made subordinate to the
pictures of Souperism. In 1878 a writer in the <span class="smcap">Dublin Review</span> said of it:
“It has not been surpassed since it was written.... The characters are so
well drawn that even those in barest outline are interesting and individual....

Nell Gower, the Scotch Spaewife (a woman gifted with second sight), discourse
in broad Scotch dialect, in contrast with the stately and imperious language
of Elizabeth, displays an unusual power of transition. No finer character
could be depicted than Alice Wentworth, daughter of Sir Geoffrey Wentworth,
the representative of an old English Catholic baronetage, who suffered persecution
under Elizabeth; whilst Roger O’Brien, attached to the Court of
Mary Queen of Scots, affords an opportunity of presenting the high-spirited
and brave qualities that ought to belong to an Irish gentleman. Elizabeth

sacred office to keep the secret of the confessional when by a word he could

priest’s agony of mind is depicted with great power and sympathy. The
other priest, Father John, is drawn as the true parish priest of the old type,
blood and bone of the people, jovial, homely, lovable and beloved. The
Author, though alien in faith and race, tells us that he knew intimately and

country idylls, humorous, pathetic, or tragic. In all there is the actuality,

<p class="book">⸺ THE RED LEAGUERS. Pp. 315. (<i>Methuen</i>). 6<i>s.</i> (N.Y.: <i>Pratt</i>).
0.75. 1904.</p>

<p>Scenes from an imaginary rebellion in Ireland, purporting to be related by
a Protestant who has sided with the rebels and captains the men of Armoy,
a barony a little to the north of the Woodford River (the Thrasna of the
story), which enters Lough Erne about two miles to the west of where the
River Erne flows into the same. England having left Ireland almost without
a garrison, the Protestants are all (except in a few places) killed or taken,
the Irish Republic triumphs. Then the country gives itself up to an orgy of
thoughtless rejoicing and more or less drunken revelling. In “a handful
of weeks” the “land is hungry, wasted, lawless, disorganized, an Ireland
gone to wrack.” The story closes with the news of English troops landing
in Cork and Derry and Dublin. The author does not write simply from the
standpoint of the dominant class, much less is he merely anti-Catholic and
anti-Irish. He merely lacks faith in the wisdom and staying power of Irish
character. He tries to show the actualities of the rebellion in their naked
realism, eschewing all romance. He succeeds in being strangely vivid and
realistic without apparent effort. Of the leaders on the Irish side one is a
coward and a swaggerer, another is bloodthirsty, all are selfish and vulgar.
The heroes are in the opposite camp.</p>

<p>N.B.—The scene of this story is also the scene of the Author’s other North
of Ireland studies and sketches.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE CUBS. Pp. 349. (<i>Werner Laurie</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1906.</p>

<p>A story of life in an Irish school, recognized by old schoolfellows of the
Author as bearing a strong resemblance to the Author’s old school of Farra,
near Mullingar. It is naturally thought to be partly autobiographical. It
is the history of a great friendship. It includes also some scenes of home
life.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ DAN THE DOLLAR. (<i>Maunsel</i>). 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> [1906]. New edition. 1908.</p>

<p>A study of national character and of human nature in which the touch is
delicate, sure, and true. The whole study is concentrated on five persons.
First there is the picture of the neglected farm of the happy, easy-going Felix.
His wife is a contrast with him in all, yet they agree perfectly. Then there
is Mary Troy, a Catholic girl living with them, a beautifully-drawn character,
and Felim, the dreamer of dreams. Into their lives suddenly comes Dan,
who after years of hard, sordid striving in the States, has made his pile.
He brings his hard, practical American materialism to bear on the improvement
of “this God-forsaken country,” with what result the reader will see.
There is a love story of an exceptional kind, handled with much subtlety and
knowledge of human nature. There is much pathos and moral beauty in the
story.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ MASTER JOHN. Pp. 281. (<i>Werner, Laurie</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1909.</p>

<p>Master John is a strong man, who makes his way in the world and returns
wealthy to settle in Fermanagh. The place he buys has a curse upon it, and
strange things happen. The story is told by an old retainer—now a car-driver—whose
verbosity and ramblingness are very quaint and amusing.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ HETTY: The Story of an Ulster Family. Pp. 322. (<i>Laurie</i>). 6<i>s.</i>
1911.</p>

<p>Essentially what the sub-title suggests, a domestic story, with careful
delineation of character for its chief interest. Old Dell is perhaps the central
figure, an old Northern farmer, reserved, silent, conservative, with his love of
the land and his unwillingness to part with his authority, even to the end.
Then there is the contrast between Hetty, quiet, retiring, peace-loving, and
her wilful, wayward younger sister Rhona, lively, quick of tongue, and beautiful.
The coming of Rhona makes shipwreck of poor Hetty’s happiness and
well-nigh brings tragedy into the family life. A quiet, slow-moving story,
intensely faithful to reality. “Problems” are in the background but are
not wearisomely worked out. There is an occasional gleam of humour,
but there is much true pathos.</p>

in his opinion—where he is captured, and taken to the Castle of the O’Connors.

He is thrown into the Tower, but is released by Essex, and goes with him to
Ireland on his fatal campaign. Careful and vivid portraits of Elizabeth,

<p class="book">⸺ IRISH LIFE IN COURT AND CASTLE. Three Vols. (<span class="smcap">London</span>). 1840.</p>

<p>Story of a young barrister named Tarleton, who while studying in London
forms a firm friendship with Gerald MacCullagh (really O’Donnell), who
becomes a nationalist leader. The latter, in spite of himself, sees the national
movement drift into one of incendiarism and robbery, resulting, among other
things, in a night attack (fully described) on Merton Castle, somewhere in
Co. Clare. Tarleton refusing to give up his friend is disowned by his father,
and comes to live in a Dublin boarding house. There are good pictures of
Dublin life, the amusing foibles of a peculiar section of the upper classes
being well hit off. The Author gives his views on the various questions of
the day. Shows how the Bar was injured by the prevalent jobbery. There
are a good many incidents, but perhaps they scarcely rescue the book from

<p>A reprint of stories that first appeared in the <span class="smcap">Dublin University Magazine</span>,

the most part, viz. I. “The Billiard Table” (ruinous results of gambling.)
II. “Reading for Honours” (a harrowing story of the fatal results of

by E. Griset. 1891.</p>

<p>Introduction by A. Nutt treats of nature and antiquity of Gaelic folk-tales,
theories about the Fenian cycle, and the classification of texts composing
it, and makes some interesting remarks about its value and import.
His notes at the end chiefly consist of references to D’Arbois de Jubainville’s
<i>List of Irish Sources</i>, and to Campbell of Islay’s <i>Leabhar na Féinne</i>. The
book collects a mass of floating and fragmentary oral tradition about the
Fians. Sources entirely oral, many of the translators knowing no word
of English. Through the greater part of the book the collector gives the
substance of what he heard, but he gives also verbatim in Gaelic, with an
English translation, many tales, poems, ballads. Nature-myth, God-myth,
folk-fancy and hero tale, prose and poetry, are mingled. Naturally the
quality varies a good deal. Some of the tales are extravagant and even silly.
Many are so corrupted in oral transmission as no longer to be intelligible.
Some are very archaic, some modern. A few are noble heroic legends in
verse, but the literal prose translation makes them somewhat obscure.

many vicissitudes he came to Dublin, where he had very varied and
painful experiences in the effort to make a living. He wrote for the
<span class="smcap">Christian Examiner</span>, the <span class="smcap">Family Magazine</span>, the <span class="smcap">Dublin University
Magazine</span>, &amp;c. He also wrote for the <span class="smcap">Nation</span>, though, as Mr.
O’Donoghue says, “Carleton never was a Nationalist, and was quite
incapable of adopting the principles of the Young Irelanders.” What
he wrote from the Nationalist standpoint was written through the need
of earning his bread. For, though famous long before his death, he
never freed himself from money troubles. Died 1869. <i>See</i> D. J.

Carleton works powerfully upon all our best feelings in turn. Particularly
touching is his picture of the depth and tenderness of family affections (he
was himself a doting father). The pictures of the hedge-schoolmaster’s
brutalities, and of the days of the pestilence are vivid. He is in this story
altogether on the side of the peasant. This little volume contains also eight

<p>Prefaces by the Author and by D. J. O’Donoghue. A powerful novel,
full of strong character study, and of deep and tragic pathos, relieved by
humorous scenes. Carleton tells us that all the characters save one are
drawn from originals well known to himself. The original of the miser’s wife,
a perfect type of the Catholic Irish mother, was his own mother. Una O’Brien
is one of the loveliest of Carleton’s heroines. Honor O’Donovan is scarcely
less admirable. The mental struggles of the miser, torn between the love
of his son and the love of his money, are finely depicted.</p>

<p>A detailed study of the character and career of an Irish land agent of the
worst type. It puts the reader on intimate terms with the prejudices, feelings,
aims, and manners of the Orangemen of the day, and bitterly satirizes them.
It gives vivid pictures of both Anglican and Dissenting proselytizing efforts.
Written from a strongly national and even Catholic standpoint. Contains
several remarkable character studies. There is Solomon M’Slime, “the
religious attorney,” sanctimonious, canting, hypocritical; Darby O’Drive,
M’Clutchy’s ruffianly bailiff, a converted Papist; the Rev. Mr. Lucre, a very
superior absentee clergyman of the Establishment, and an ardent proselytizer;
the old priest, Father Roche, very sympathetically drawn. The bias throughout
is very strong and undisguised. There are some grotesquely and irresistibly
comic scenes, but there are also fine scenes of tragic interest. “Nothing in
literature,” says Mr. O’Donoghue, “could be more terrible than some of the
scenes in this book.” He calls it “one of Carleton’s most amazing efforts.”
Of the book as a whole, Mr. Krans says: “It is one of the most daring pictures
of Irish country life ever executed.” And Mr. G. Barnett Smith speaks of the
eviction scene as “unexampled for its sadness and pathos.”</p>

there is an interesting picture of one of Father Mathew’s meetings. Father

<p>The plot centres in a rural murder mystery, but there are many threads
in the narrative. As a background there is the Famine and typhus-plague
of 1817, described with appalling power and realism. Of this the Author himself
was a witness, and he assures us that he has in no wise exaggerated the
horrors. All through there are passages of true and heart-rending pathos,
lit up by the humorous passages of arms between Jemmy Branigan and his
master, the middleman, Dick o’ the Grange. Many peculiar types of that
day appear: Skinadre the rural miser, Donnell Dhu the Prophecyman.
There is not a word in the book that could hurt Catholic or national feeling.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE EMIGRANTS OF AHADARRA. [1847]. (<i>Routledge</i>). 1<i>s.</i>
(N.Y.: <i>Sadleir</i>). 1.50.</p>

<p>A story of rural life, depicting with much beauty and pathos the sadness
of emigration. The book is first and foremost a love story and has no didactic
object. It contains one of Carleton’s most exquisite portraits of an Irish
peasant girl. The struggle between her love and her stern and uncompromising
zeal for the faith is finely drawn. O’Finigan, with his half-tipsy
grandiloquence, is also cleverly done. A kindly spirit pervades the book,
and it is almost entirely free from the bad taste, coarseness, and rancour
which show themselves at times in Carleton.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE TITHE-PROCTOR. (<span class="smcap">Belfast</span>: <i>Simms &amp; M’Intyre</i>). [1849].</p>

<p>Founded on real events, the murder of the Bolands, a terrible agrarian
crime. Written in a mood of savage resentment against his countrymen.
D. J. O’Donoghue says of this book: “It is a vicious picture of the worst
passions of the people, a rancorous description of the just war of the peasantry
against tithes, and some of the vilest types of the race are there held up to
odium, not as rare instances of villainy, but as specimens of humanity quite
commonly to be met with.” Yet there are good portraits and good scenes.
Among the former are Mogue Moylan, the Cannie Soogah, Dare-devil O’Driscoll,
Buck English, and the Proctor himself. The latter, hated of the
people, is painted in dark colours. “As a study of villainy,” says Mr.
O’Donoghue, “the book is convincing. There is one touching and fine
scene—that in which the priest stealthily carries a sack of oats to the starving
Protestant minister and his family.” “As a study of Irish life,” says Mr.
O’Donoghue again, “even in the anti-tithe war time it is a perversion of
facts, and a grotesque accumulation of melodramatic horrors.”</p>

was imperfectly qualified. “It reminds one,” says Mr. O’Donoghue, “at a
superficial examination, of Lever, but is far inferior to any of that writer’s
works. It is full of rancour and rage, and makes painful and exasperating
reading: the best that can be said for it is that there are pages here and

pleasant, readable romantic melodrama, founded on the famous ballad,

<p class="book">⸺ THE BLACK BARONET. Pp. 476, close print. (<i>Duffy</i>). 2<i>s.</i> [1856].
Still reprinted.</p>

<p>A tragedy of upper-class society life. The interest lies chiefly in the intricate
plot, which, however, is distinctly melodramatic. There is little attempt
to portray the manners of the society about which the book treats, and there
is little character-drawing. The tragedy is relieved by humorous scenes
from peasant life. In the Preface the Author tells us that the circumstances
related in the story really happened. Contains a touching picture of an
evicted tenant, who leaves the hut in which his wife lies dead and his children
fever-stricken to seek subsistence by a life of crime. “There is nothing,”
says G. Barnett Smith in <span class="smcap">The XIXth. Century</span> (Author of notice of C. in

scene of this novel.” And he rates it very high.</p>

mainly in the rescue by O’Hanlon of a girl who had been abducted. Moral

Father Moran and Rev. Mr. Bayley, the priest and the rector, bosom friends,

<p>This work constitutes the completest and most authentic picture ever given
to us of the life of the peasantry in the first quarter of the last century. It
is the more interesting in that it depicts an Ireland wholly different from the
Ireland of our days, a state of things that has quite passed away. Speaking
of the <i>Traits</i>, Mr. D. J. O’Donoghue says that, “taken as a whole, there is
nothing in Irish literature within reasonable distance of them for completeness,
variety, character-drawing, humour, pathos and dramatic power.” And
most Irishmen would be at one with him. About the absolute life-like
reality of his peasants there can be no doubt. But reserves must be made
as to his fairness and impartiality. To the edition of 1854 he prefixed an
introduction, in which he states his intention “to aid in removing many
absurd prejudices ... against his countrymen,” and in particular the conception
of the “stage Irishman.” He then enters into a vindication and a
eulogy of the national character which is fully in accord with national sentiment.
But many of the stories were originally written for a violently anti-national
and anti-Catholic periodical. Some of the <i>Traits</i> were consequently
marred by offensive passages, some of which the author himself afterwards
regretted. He frequently betrays the rancour he felt against the religion
which he had abandoned. The Catholic clergy in particular he never treated
fairly, and in some of the <i>Traits</i> ridicule is showered upon them, <i>e.g.</i>, in “The
Station.” Yet in others, <i>e.g.</i>, “The Poor Scholar,” things Catholic are treated
with perfect propriety. In 1845 Thomas Davis wrote for the <span class="smcap">Nation</span> a very
appreciative article on Carleton. The illustrations by Phiz are very clever,
but many of them are simply caricatures of the Irish peasantry.</p>

Memory has no doubt cast a golden haze over the scenes and persons, idealizing

the form of stories, and are told with zest. Some are sad enough, but with a
sadness that is softened by the kindly genial spirit of the teller. The writer
is of course in complete sympathy with the people. Many queer types
(Micky the Fenian, the bell-man, Mad Matt the tramp, the polite beggar,
the believer in ghosts, &amp;c.) are studied in these sketches. “There is not one

<p>Dedicated to Lord Holland (then Henry Fox). A series of adventures of

dispensary, and how two members of the Force arrested the County Inspector
on a charge of Sunday drinking. The local colour and the dialect are perfect,
and the local types well sketched.</p>

<p>The scene is laid in Ulster: the personages are Irish Presbyterians. The

<p>Deals with an imaginary landing of James II. to head a rising in Ireland.
Scene: first on shores of Bantry Bay, then in Celbridge. A plot to seize
Dublin Castle, in which the King is aided by Swift, fails through divisions
caused by sectarian hatred. A rapidly moving story with many exciting
situations. Though no elaborate picture of the times is attempted, innumerable
small touches show the Author’s thorough acquaintance with
their history and literature. The style is pleasant, and the conversations
seldom jar by being too modern in tone.</p>

<p>A very romantic story of Killarney in the days of Elizabeth’s wars with
Hugh O’Neill. Sir Bertram Fitzroy, a gallant young Englishman, comes
over with Essex, and is sent down to Killarney. He becomes friendly with
the Irish and falls in love with the “Mermaid” Eva, a young lady who chose
this disguise for greater safety. She wins him to love Ireland. They are
kept apart by the schemes of the villain O’Fergus, standard bearer to O’Neill.
But, after a scene of considerable dramatic power in which O’Fergus is slain,
they are united again. There are many adventures, and much fighting.
Killarney well described. In sympathy with Ireland. No religious bias.</p>

<p>A series of episodes, somewhat idealised by memory, from the annals of

family and some of the neighbouring chieftains’ families. A great deal of

businesslike, and miserly. Contact with Irish life softens the Englishman’s
asperities. Full of genuinely humorous and amusing adventures of Sandy
with race-horses and hounds, and other things. The brogue is not overdone

in man’s clothes, acted as whip. Tinker is a yellow mongrel who does many
wonderful things in the course of the story. The main interest centres in the
doings of these three, chiefly in the hunting field. A melodramatic element
is introduced by the attempt of the father of the wealthy heiress Grania
Hume to steal her jewels. Of course there are love affairs also. A breezy
story, with much lively incident and pleasant humour.</p>

in Ireland. Tells of the wholly inexperienced Antony’s adventures among
horse-sharpers, of his devotion to his old uncle, and of the social barriers
that for long keep him aloof from his own class and from his future wife.
The backwardness and slovenliness of Irish life are a good deal exaggerated,
but the story is very cleverly told, with a good deal of dry humour. The

<p>Tipperary in the years before (and during) the Famine of 1846. Glimpses of
Tipperary homes, both clerical and lay. Almost every aspect of Irish life at
the time is pictured—the Famine, Souperism, an Irish agent and his victims
(ch. xii.), how St. Patrick’s Day is kept, Irish horse races (ch. ii.), &amp;c. “I
have shewn how the people are made the catspaw of aspiring politicians
[elections are described] and needy landlords.” Author says the characters
are taken from real life. They are for the most part very well drawn, <i>e.g.</i>,
Mr. Baker, “a regular Jack Falstaff,” full of boast about wonderful but
wholly imaginary exploits; and Father O’Donnell. A pleasant little love-story
runs through the book. The whole is racy of the soil. The dialect is
good, but the conversations of the upper class are artificial and scarcely true

<p>The Author calls this a historical romance, but the element of romance
is very small. Ch. I. gives a backward glance over Ireland’s national struggle
in the past. The nominal hero is Hugh O’Donnell and the heroine Eveleen,
granddaughter of Florence McCarthy, killed on the Rhine. But Sarsfield is
the central figure, and the Author contrives to give us his whole career.
There is plenty of exciting incident, partly fictitious—forays of the Rapparees,
captures, escapes. In spite of the schemes of the villain rival, Saunders,
hero and heroine are united. The historical standpoint seems fair if not
quite impartial.</p>

the bad times. Famine and eviction and death wreck its peace, and things
are only partially righted after many years. The author, whose view-point
is nationalist and Catholic, vividly describes the evils of the time—the terrible
sufferings of the Famine, eviction as carried out by a heartless agent, souperism
in the person of Rev. Mr. Sly, judicial murder as exemplified by the execution

tail through the streets of Clonmel, seizures for tithes, the execution of Father
Sheehy (an avowed anachronism), &amp;c. Chief historical personages: Sir

<p>In the title story we have two attempted suicides of parents distraught
with grief, the return of a former convict, and an inheritance for the people
who were dying with hunger. Dublin is the scene. The next story, “Grace
Kennedy,” takes place in the Queen’s Co.: a mother murders her boy, the
sister holds the corpse to the fire and “nestles beside him.” In “The
Foundling” the mother drowns herself, but some charitable Protestants
rescue her child and bring him up in their religion. “Ellen Seaton” tells
how Ellen’s father goes off to be a priest and her mother to be a nun, and
deals with the efforts made by priests and nuns to get hold of her. Finally
she converts her nun jailer and both escape. In some of these stories the
Author introduces very vulgar brogue, with coarse expressions.</p>

works. A story of an Oxford man who came to Ireland as <i>locum tenens</i> in
the most disturbed time, and found life a good deal more exciting than at
his English curacy. The Orangemen are very favourably represented. In
the preface to the following work the Author says of this, “The Reign of

(<i>Elliot Stock</i>). [1875]. 1900.</p>

<p>The first six chapters are autobiographical, the remaining sixty-five are a
series of anecdotes and stories in which the Catholic clergy and the doctrines
of the Church appear to great disadvantage. The lawlessness and brutality
of the peasantry are also much insisted on, and the conversion of Ireland to
Protestantism seems to obsess the writer. Some of the incidents related are
improbable in the extreme, and it is not clear from the Preface to what extent
the Author intended them as narratives of actual fact. At all events they
are told in the form of fiction. There are also gruesome reminiscences of
agrarian disturbances and of the Fenian outbreak, and a chapter against
Home Rule. The Author was born in Dublin in the twenties, of Scottish
parents. He went to T.C.D. in 1847. He was long Vicar of Kinsale. He was

<p class="book">⸺ THE SOUNDLESS TIDE. Pp. 328. (<i>Arnold</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1911.</p>

<p>Life of country gentry and peasantry in County Down. With the latter
the Author is particularly effective, bringing out their characteristics with
quiet “pawky” humour. Especially, there is Mrs. M’Killop and her wise
saws. But the Colonel and his wife are also very well drawn. There is
pathos as well as humour. Noteworthy also are the descriptions of sea-coast
scenery, and the story of the fight on the “twalth”—(I.B.L.). It is a
simple tale of lover’s misunderstandings. Religious strife is pictured with
perhaps undue insistence.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ TINKER’S HOLLOW. Pp. 336. (<i>Arnold</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1912.</p>

<p>A charming and delicately-told love story, with a background of life among
the Presbyterians (both the better class, and the peasantry and servants)
near a small town in Co. Antrim. Shows an intimate and sympathetic
knowledge of the people that furnishes the characters of the story. The
dialect is perfectly reproduced. There is a pleasant picture of the bright
and sunny Sally Bruce growing from girlhood into womanhood amid the dull
austerity of Coole House, in the society of her two maiden aunts and her
bachelor uncle. There are pleasant gleams of Northern humour, not a few
gems of rustic philosophy, and vignettes of Antrim scenery. The human
interest is, however, strongest of all.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE BLIND SIDE OF THE HEART. Pp. 299. (<i>Maunsel</i>). 6<i>s.</i>
1915.</p>

<p>The story of Dick Sandford’s choice between his cousin Betty—English like
himself—bright, charming, wholly of this world, and Ethne Blake whom he
meets while on a visit to Ireland. The book is really a study, or rather an
imaginative presentment of this strange, almost unearthly, figure as typifying
the mystic, faery side of the Celtic temperament, and of the background of
haunted Irish landscape and peasant fairy-lore, against which she moves.
The vital difference in the two temperaments, Celt and Saxon, is
suggested throughout. The peasantry of the remote mountain glens are
pictured with sympathy and insight.</p>

New edition. 1903.</p>

<p>A love story, beginning in the Andamans. There is a lively picture of
garrison life, including the clever portrait of the “leading lady” (and tyrant),
Mrs. Creery. The lovers are separated by the scheming of an unsuccessful
rival. The girl first lives a Cinderella life, with disagreeable relations in
London, then is a governess, and finally (p. 256) goes to a relation in Ireland.
Then there are amusing studies of Irish types—carmen (Larry Flood, with
his famous “Finnigan’s mare”), and servants, and a family of broken-down
gentry. Things come right in the end.</p>

<p>Story of an Irish girl of good family, who is obliged to train horses for a

<p>A sympathetic study of Ulster Presbyterian life is the background for the
romance, ending in tragedy, of a young minister. Besides the occasional
dialect (well handled) there is little of Ireland in the book, but the story is
told with much skill, and never flags. Bromley, an unbeliever, almost a
cynic, but a true man and unselfish to the point of heroism, is a remarkable
study. The author has also published <i>The Crack of Doom</i>, <i>The King’s Oak</i>,
<i>For England’s Sake</i>, &amp;c.</p>

disgust of her social circle, falls in love with her father’s servant boy. The
latter goes to America, and thence returns, a wealthy man, to claim Lily.
The scenery is well described and the dialect well rendered. A healthy and
high-toned novel.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ BLACK ABBEY. Pp. 447. (<i>Sampson, Low</i>). [1880]. 1882.</p>

<p>We are first introduced to a delightful circle, the three children of Black
Abbey (somewhere in Co. Down) and those about them, their German governess
and Irish nurse and their playmate Bella, born in America, granddaughter
of the old Presbyterian minister. The picture of their home-life is pleasant
and life-like, with a vein of quiet humour. Then they grow up and things
no longer run smoothly. Bella, by her marriage, well-nigh wrecks four lives,
including her own, but things seem to be righting themselves as the story closes.
The dialect of the Northern servants is very well done. The tone of the book
is most wholesome though by no means “goody-goody.”</p>

<p class="author"><b>CROSBIE, Mary.</b> Born in England. Educated privately and at various

<p class="book">⸺ KINSMEN’S CLAY. Pp. 389. (Close print). (<i>Methuen</i>). 6<i>s.</i> First
and second editions. 1910.</p>

<p>Main theme: wife and lover waiting for invalid and impossible husband to
die. The treatment of this theme and that of a minor plot makes the book
unsuited for certain classes of readers. Moreover, the tone is alien to religion.
God is “perhaps the flowering of men’s ideals under the rain of their tears.”
But the tone is not frankly anti-moral. The personages are all of the country
Anglo-Irish gentry, except one peasant family, and this shows up badly.
The types are drawn with much skill, and there is constant clever analysis of
moods and emotions. The story brings out in a vague way the transmission
through a family of ancestral peculiarities.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ BRIDGET CONSIDINE. Pp. 347. (<i>Bell</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1914.</p>

<p>Bridget’s father is the son of a broken-down shopkeeper somewhere beyond

along with “Lennie-next-door,” but her mind outgrows his. She goes to
stay W. of the Shannon as secretary to a rich lady. There she becomes
engaged to Hugh Delmege, a young landowner. All her yearnings seem
fulfilled, yet somehow it is not what she had expected; a short separation
from Hugh still further opens her eyes, and she returns disillusioned. This
is the bare skeleton: it does not do justice to the philosophy and the style
of the book, both of which are remarkable.</p>

<p>“A tale of a Cromwellian Irish town [in Munster]. Being the autobiography
of Miss Annita Lombard.” A picture of the pitiful failure of the United
Irishmen to raise and inspirit a people turned to mean, timid, and crawling
slaves by ages of oppression. Thad Lombard, sacrificing fortune, home,
happiness, and at last his life for the Lost Land, is a noble figure. The book
is a biting and powerful satire upon various types of anglicized or vulgar or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
pharisaical Catholicism (the author is a Catholic). The whole is a picture of
unrelieved gloom. The style, beautiful, and often poetic, but deepens the
sadness. Thad Lombard, a hundred years before the time, pursues the ideals
of the Gaelic League. Period: <i>c.</i> 1780-1797.</p>

Though imperfectly acquainted with the art of a novelist this writer is

<p class="book">⸺ TO-DAY IN IRELAND. Three Vols. (<span class="smcap">London</span>: <i>Knight</i>). 1825.</p>

<p>Four stories:—1. “The Carders.” 2. “Connemara.” 3. “Old and New Light.”
4. “The O’Toole’s Warning.” The scene of 1 is “Rathfinnan,” on Lough Ree,
not far from Athlone. It is a very dark picture of the secret societies and
of the peasants in general, but an equally merciless picture of certain types
of the Ascendancy class, notably a Protestant curate and Papist-hunter
named Crosthwaite. The hero Arthur Dillon (a true hero of romance) is
a young Catholic student of T.C.D., who narrowly escapes being implicated
in the secret societies. He dreams of rebellion, and is nearly caught in the
meshes of a villainous-plotting Jesuit. There is a love story, with a happy
ending. 2. Is a burlesque story telling how M’Laughlin, a sort of King
of Connemara, escaped his debtors in a coffin. Some smuggling episodes.
Description of the fair of Ballinasloe, p. 196. Much about wild feudal
hospitality and lawlessness. 3. Is a satirical study of Protestant religious
life at “Ardenmore,” Co. Louth. “Sir Starcourt Gibbs” seems obviously
intended as a portrait of Sir Harcourt Lees, an Evangelical Orange leader
in Dublin in the twenties and thirties.</p>

Dr. Dee the Astrologer, Queen Elizabeth herself. The Author has worked
into the slight framework of her story an elaborate and careful picture of
the times, the fruit, she tells us, of years of study and research. As a result
the romance is overlaid and well-nigh smothered with erudition, apart even
from the learned notes appended to each volume. The Author is obviously
inspired by a great love and enthusiasm for Ireland, and takes the national
side thoroughly. The book is ably written, but resembles rather a treatise

<p>“Twenty tales” says Douglas Hyde (Pref. to <i>Beside the Fire</i>), “told
very well, and with much less cooking and flavouring than his predecessors

(Mr. Curtin knowing not a word of Gaelic). Beyond this fact he
does not tell us where, from whom, or how he collected the stories. Dr.

<p>Learned introduction speculates on origin of myths of primitive races.
Compares Gaelic myths with those of other races, especially North American
Indians. Contends that the characters in the tales are personifications of
natural forces and the elements, and that the tales themselves in their

consists of twenty-four folk-lore stories dealing chiefly with heroes of the
Gaelic cycles. Not interesting in themselves, and with much sameness in
style, matter, and incident. There is some naturalistic coarseness here and
there, and the tone in some places is vulgar. The stories were told to the

<p>Six short stories, reprinted from <span class="smcap">Dublin University Magazine</span>, entitled
“The Identification,” “The Banker of Ballyfree,” “The Reprieve,” “The
Two Mullanys,” “M’Cormack’s Grudge,” “How ‘The Chief’ was Robbed.”
They deal chiefly with remarkable trials in Ireland. “They are all founded
upon facts which occurred within my own personal knowledge; and for the

Still in print.</p>

<p>A faithful and sympathetic picture of the peasant life and manners at the
time (early nineteenth century). The Author, a police officer, has drawn on
his professional experiences. The tale, founded on fact, is an edifying one
despite the unrelieved villainy of Tom Murdock. The influence of religion is
felt throughout, especially in the heroic charity of the heroine even towards
the murderer of her lover. Peasant speech reproduced to the life.</p>

<p>The supposed teller began as a supporter of “law and order,” but the
conviction of the abuses of landlordism is forced upon him by experience and
observation, and he ends by joining the secret society of the Whitefeet.

<p>A murder mystery. The hero is wrongly accused, but is acquitted in the
end. The real culprit (scapegrace son of the victim, Lord Elmsdale) confesses
when dying. The mystery is well kept up to the end. Indeed, the
explanation of it is by no means clear, even at the close. The moral purpose
is kept prominently before the reader throughout. Tone strongly religious
and Catholic, the Protestant religion being more than once compared, to its
disadvantage, with the Catholic.</p>

<p>“The reader who expects in this narrative what is commonly called the
plot, or story, of a novel will, we fairly warn him, be disappointed. Our
object in becoming the historian of Howard is merely to trace the impressions
produced on his mind by the very varied principles and notions with which
he came in contact” (beginning of chap. xiii.). The book is, besides, a very
satirical study of various types of Ulster Protestantism, and a controversial
novel, reference to Scripture and to various Catholic authorities being frequently
given in footnotes. The story, a slight one, moves slowly, but the
situations have a good deal of humour.</p>

James I. Scene varies between England, Ireland, and Scotland. Opens in
1609. Portrait of James I. No other historical personage. Persecution,
arrest, and adventures of Father Hugh Talbot. Chief interest lies in the
picture of the times, which is carefully drawn. The story, however, is well
told, the conversations clever and fairly natural, the character-drawing
good. The Author is strongly opposed to religious persecution. The Irish

<p>Adventures of a penniless young gentleman trying to get a position. Depicts
(after Lever), first life in Galway, among impecunious, fox-hunting, hard-drinking,
duelling squires (Blakes, Bodkins, and O’Carrolls); then the vapid
life of Castle aristocracy in the Dublin of the time, with its place-hunting
and ignoble time-serving. Incidentally (for the author does not
moralise) we have glimpses of the working of the Penal laws. The story is an
unexciting one of rather matter-of-fact courtship and of domestic intrigue.
There are not a few amusing scenes, nothing objectionable, and little bias.
A striking character study is that of the Rev. Julius Blake, who is of the tribe
of Pecksniff, but with quite distinctive features.</p>

<p>We are used to having depicted with painful realism all our faults, all the
defects of Irish life on the material side. This little book denies none of
these, but it shows another side of the Irish character, the deep-rooted,
intense Catholic faith, the union with the supernatural, that brightens even
the most squalid lives. The anecdotes, which are true, are related with
delicate insight by one who knows and loves the people. There is a vivid
sketch of a Lough Derg pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Six little tales, slight in theme, but delicately wrought. They are the
poetry of real life, mostly Irish peasant life. A moral may be gleaned from
each, but there is no irritating insistence on it. One tells how, through his
love for birds and his fear of frightening them, a good old P.P. loses his chance
of a canonry. Another tells of the beautiful neighbourly charity of the Irish
peasant. Four are love stories. They are perfect of their kind.</p>

preaching or moralising, by one in thorough sympathy with the people, and
alive, too, to all the influences of nature. The dialect is reproduced with
great fidelity.</p>

<p>Eight little studies—vignettes—of Irish peasant types, evidently drawn
direct from real life. They are in narrative form, but in most the incident is
slight. They give curiously vivid glimpses of the life of the poor, of which the

<p>Relates to the Donegal Highlands and Connemara, in the latter of which
(at Spiddal, I believe) the writer taught Irish. Consists of illustrations of
the peasants’ belief in the preternatural world of spirits and fairies and
influences, with examples of common superstitious practices. The writer,
if he does not share these beliefs, at least is very far from despising them.
“The majority of them [the items included] were related to me in the broken
English of a Western peasant”—(Introd.). The book is chiefly interesting to
folk-lorists.</p>

<p>Eleven stories of Sligo peasant life. The Author has thorough sympathy

warning against emigration is conveyed in this latter part of the story. Mrs.

endeavour to place the heroic virtues of new Christians in contrast with the
decaying Druidic paganism. The writer claims the Abbé McGeoghegan’s
authority (also that of Mooney and Carey) for her descriptions of the Ireland

Tara, the story and its setting are purely imaginary and ideal. The Druids

<p>Nora is only a servant girl, but is, without suspecting it, a true heroine.
But she is no saint, and has a sharp tongue in her head. Her witty sallies
are cleverly reproduced. The author tells us that Nora was a “real and
living person.” John Halloran takes part in the rising of ’48, and is obliged to
fly to America. Nora vows not to settle down in life until the fortunes of
the Hallorans are restored. She goes to America, works to support the
family, which has been ruined by an informer, and at length finds Halloran and
reunites the family once more. Scene: near Holy Cross Abbey on the Suir;
afterwards Boston. On the whole the tone and style are very emotional,
but with an emotion that rings true. This is relieved by not a few gleams
of pleasant humour. Irish dialect well done. Sympathy strongly national.</p>

<p>A tale of the Clare coast and its fishing population (drawn with much skill
and fidelity) half a century back. The story centres in a mysterious and
romantic rock unapproachable by sea and connected with the land by a
single rope only. There is a mysterious owner, or rather a series of them,
and mysterious gold. But the central idea of the book (one of the most
original in literature, it has been justly called) is the study of a deaf-mute who,
by brooding on his own misfortune, grows to envy and then to hate his own
child, because the child can hear and speak.</p>

<p class="author"><b>DOWNEY, Edmund; “F. M. Allen.”</b> Born (1856) and educated in Waterford.
Being the son of a shipbroker, he came to know well the various sea
types that frequent a port. Went to London at twenty-two, and became
partner in the firm of Ward and Downey. Retired in 1890, and in 1894
founded Downey &amp; Co. Both of these firms, especially the latter, did
a great deal for the publishing of Irish books. His writings are many
and varied. They include humorous sketches, extravaganzas, sea
stories, fairy tales, sensational stories, a biography of Lever, a volume
of reminiscences, and a history of Waterford, and the two novels, <i>Clashmore</i>
and the <i>Merchant of Killogue</i>. He at present carries on a publishing

<p>This now famous book belongs to the same class as the <i>Comic History of

of historical or pseudo-historical episodes purporting to be related by a
humorous Waterford countryman, Dan Banim, as seen from his point of
view. Kings and princes, saints and ancient heroes, all play their parts
in the delightful comedy, and talk in the broadest brogue. “From Portlaw to
Paradise,” one of the best known, may be taken as a type. King James’s
escape after the Boyne is also admirably done.</p>

<p>A tale of a mystery centering in the strange disappearance of Lord Clashmore
and his agent. The story is healthy in tone, and never flags. There
is a pleasant love interest. The dénouement is of an original and unexpected
kind. The scene is the neighbourhood of Tramore and Dunmore, Co. Waterford.
There is little or no study of national problems or national life, but
some shrewd remarks about things Irish are scattered here and there in the

<p>Fourteen capital yarns told with great verve and go just for the sake
of the story. They are all humorous, just avoiding uproarious farce. The
personages of the stories are the various queer types to be met with in a small
southern port:—the convivial spirits in the local semi-genteel club, those
of lower degree who foregather in the bar parlour of the “Dragon,” the
rival editors of the local papers, the candidates for the harbour mastership,
the skippers of the Dunleary steam-packet company, the professional jail-bird—Micky
Malowney, and the “general play boy” Jeremiah Maguire.
There is no stage Irishism, and no politics. Dunleary is, of course, W—rf—d.</p>

<p>A dozen stories supposed to be told by one Pat Murphy, in the humorous
brogue affected by country story-tellers. Comic character and incident in
neighbourhood of Northern town. Considerably above the usual books of
comic sketches. A good example of the humour is “The Creamery Society”—the
visit of the Department’s expert, and his failure to make butter from
whitewash, and the difficulties that arise incidentally between Nationalists
and Orangemen, followed by Father Connolly’s famous speech. Perhaps

<p>A homely, pleasant tale relating the pathetic life-story of two brothers of the

Vale of Shanganagh, Co. Dublin, afterwards it changes to Wales, and then

endeavour throughout has been to draw a faithful and sympathetic picture
of the life of the humbler classes. The sorrow and misfortune of emigration
is feelingly rendered.</p>

<p>A series of fictitious conversations purporting to take place over the counter

Dooley, “traveller, historian, social observer, saloon-keeper, economist, and
philosopher,” who has not been out of his ward for twenty-five years “but
twict,” and his friend Hennessy. From the cool heights of life in the Archey
Road Mr. Dooley muses, philosophizes, moralizes on the events and ideas of
the day. He talks in broad brogue (perhaps overdone), but his sayings are
full of dry humour, and the laugh is always with him. Many of these sayings
have the point and brevity of epigrams. No ridicule is cast on Irish character,
with which the Author, himself an Irishman, obviously sympathizes. The

religious bias, and sympathizing with certain Irish grievances. Humour,
pathos, and brogue are absent.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE QUICKSANDS OF LIFE. Pp. 392. (<i>Milne</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1908.</p>

<p>Scene: first half in England, portion of second half on an estate somewhere
in the South of Ireland. The interest centres chiefly in the plot, which is complicated,
a great many of the personages passing through quite an extraordinary
number of vicissitudes. Though the Author is never prurient, a
considerable number of dishonest “love” intrigues are introduced, treated
in a matter-of-fact way as every-day occurrences. Of Ireland there is not
very much. The land troubles furnish incidents for the story, but are not
discussed. The Irish aristocracy shows up somewhat badly in the book.
Some tributes are paid to the virtues of the Irish peasantry.</p>

<p class="author"><b>EDGEWORTH, Maria.</b> Scott, in his Preface to <i>Waverley</i> (1829), speaks
of “the extended and well-merited fame of Miss Edgeworth, whose
Irish characters have gone so far to make the English familiar with the
character of their gay and kind-hearted neighbours of Ireland.” And
he continues: “Without being so presumptuous as to hope to emulate
the rich humour, the pathetic tenderness, and admirable tact, which
pervade the works of my accomplished friend, I felt that something
might be attempted for my own country, of the same kind as that which
Miss Edgeworth has so fortunately achieved for Ireland.” She came
of an old County Longford family, but was born in England in 1767;
her father was a landed proprietor at Edgeworthstown, Co. Longford,
whose life she afterwards wrote. Most of her long life was spent in
Ireland. She came to know the Irish peasantry very well, though from
outside, and also the country life of the nobility and gentry. She had
much sympathy for Ireland, but was unable to understand that radical
changes were needful if the grievances that weighed upon the country<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
were to be removed. She died in 1849. The circulation of her books
has been enormous, and they are still frequently reprinted both in these
countries and in America.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>A picture of the feudal gentry in the latter half of the seventeenth century,
in the form of reminiscences by an old retainer of the glories of the family he
had served. One after another, he tells the careers of his various masters,
the wild waste and endless prodigality of one, the skinflint exactingness of
another. There is no religious bias nor discussion of problems, the chief
interest being the ingenuous and unquestioning devotion of the old servant

<p>A vivid impression of the Irish nobility trying to dazzle London society,
and to prove itself more English than the English themselves, while the
English great ladies mock at their parvenu extravagance and outlandish
ways. The fine lady spends her days in social emulation, while her lord
sinks to the company of toadies and hangers-on, until the conscience of the
young heir is aroused by a tour in Ireland, and he brings the family back
to their estates. The peasants are drawn purely in their relation of grateful
and patient dependents.</p>

him at every turn.—(<i>Krans</i>).</p>

impulsive young hero, is introduced by an officer of the Irish Brigade.

The development of feeling and character, very often as revealed in

<p>Messrs. Methuen in 1904 reprinted the book from the fourth ed. which

and his friend were what were then called bucks and bloods. There is
much absurdity, and extreme exaggeration. The follies and vagaries of the
two heroes are told in a facetious and roistering style. There is not a little
coarseness. But the book is interesting for its side-lights on the period,
1820-1830. Geo. IV.’s visit is described in a vein of burlesque. The
illustrations are even more vulgar than the text, but have a similar interest.</p>

humorous story about the Well of St. Brigid in the Vale of Avoca—told
in North of Ireland dialect! In “The Fool,” John O’Moyle, a little “astray

<p class="book">⸺ MRS. MARTIN’S MAN. Pp. 312. (<i>Maunsel</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1915.</p>

<p>Theme: the triumph of an injured wife over a situation that would have
finally wrecked the lives of most women—her desertion by an unfaithful
husband, and, still harder to face, his return after sixteen years, a worthless
drunken lout, to live with her again. Mrs. Martin is the book, which is both
a careful character study and a page of life-philosophy. But the minor
characters are good—the Presbyterian clergyman, verbose and self-sufficient
(a very unfavourable portrait), the canting and narrow-minded Henry
Mahaffy, and Mrs. Martin’s Man himself. There is a somewhat drab background
of lower middle-class life in Ulster (Ballyreagh (= Donaghadee) and
Belfast). A very remarkable book that has had a deservedly great success.
As for its moral aspect, the Author is against cant, hypocrisy, and intolerance;
he is somewhat contemptuous towards religion: he is never salacious, but
there is an occasional sensuousness in his treatment of a painful subject.</p>

<p>“The story of a man’s quest for God.” (Sub-t.). Scene: chiefly

the inward religious and outward social life of a Presbyterian minister, Gideon
Horville, his difficulties, aspirations, friendships, disappointment in marriage.
He is dismissed by his Church for teaching erroneous doctrines, begins to
write, and subsequently helps his great friend Lord Tomnitoul in his religious
and socialistic schemes. The Author’s religious attitude is equally opposed
to Catholicism, to Calvinism, and, indeed, to Christianity. The background,
Horville’s social circle, with its meannesses, spites, and petty jealousies, is
not a pleasant one. The Author writes with thorough knowledge. There
are no politics.</p>

<p>Aims (cf. Preface) to indicate the causes that led to failure of Confederation
of Kilkenny. Represents in the characters introduced the aims and motives
of the chief actors in the events of the period, such as Owen Roe O’Neill,
Rinuccini, Sir Charles Coote, &amp;c. There is a spirited description of the
first relief of Derry, the Battle of Benburb, Ireton’s siege of Limerick. The
hero is an exile returned from a continental army. Between him and the
heroine the villain Plunkett interposes his schemes. Scene: chiefly an
island in Lough Derg. Though the main aim is historical, this fact in no
way detracts from the interest and excitement of the romance. Written in
a style above that of the majority of Irish historical novels. Standpoint:
Catholic and national, but free from violent partisanship.</p>

the inevitable like a brave man, and loses his life in trying to do a service,
for her sake, to the favoured suitor. The Irish characters are capitally

<p>An argument in narrative form against the celibacy of the Catholic priesthood.
Ruth W., flying from a home made unhappy by evangelicalism,
takes refuge with Fr. O’H., P.P. of Blossomvale, who receives her into the
Catholic Church. Fr. O’H. falls madly in love with her, and there are a
series of situations, compromising and equivocal in appearance. Under
extraordinary circumstances the two are forced into a merely formal marriage.
We need not reveal the sequel. There is a great deal about Catholic usages,
priests, nuns, &amp;c., with which the Author shows considerable superficial
acquaintance. The Author is cautiously fair in detail, but the general impression
produced is sometimes distinctly unfavourable to Catholicism. The
New Christians are a sect of latter-day evangelicals whom the Author satirises
severely. One scene we consider particularly offensive to Catholic feeling
and highly improbable into the bargain.</p>

<p>Eight stories, six of which are Irish in subject. Seven of the stories are

comes home to find that the wife and children of the reality are far other
than what his dreams had pictured, and his wife has a similar disillusionment.
He is an outsider, and he realises it bitterly. Painful tragedy is the outcome.
The 2nd is a tragedy of blighted hopes. The 3rd a lighter story laid in
Fenian times. 4. W. of Ireland. Love’s young dream destroyed by the
plotting of an ambitious and masterful old woman. Atmosphere of loneliness
and terror given to the whole. 5. A London slum tragedy, with Irish
characters. 6. A study in character, and a peasant love-tale. All are told
in beautiful and refined language, often charged with pathos. The situations

faithfully reproduced. The stories are interesting in themselves, and very
well told. Dr. Mahaffy referred in the <i>Academy</i> to one of them as the
funniest Irish story in print. There is no condescension in the Author’s
tone. He likes and respects, as well as enjoys, his peasant companions.

<p>Career of an unprincipled lawyer, who gains judgeship by a series of crimes
and keeps it by crimes even more heinous. A greatly overdrawn picture
of a dark and unpleasant side of life. Such incidents as a packed jury condemning
unjustly the presiding judge’s son (with the judge’s own approbation)
to penal servitude seem wholly improbable. The parson and his wife afford
a gleam of humour. Although some of the worst of the characters are
Protestants, there are several apparent sneers at things Catholic. “It is
not written virginibus puerisque.”—(<i>I.B.L.</i>). The career of Blanco Hamilton
seems to be founded on that of Judge Keogh, and the incidental references
are to the latter’s times. Other novels of this writer, a Corkman, living in

<p>The book is in two parts—the first a reflection or picture of the mind and
soul of the Irish peasant, the second of that of the English peasant. The
comparison or contrast is not elaborated nor insisted upon. The pictures are
there, the reader judges. A series of short stories or studies form the traits
of the pictures, bringing out such points as the kindness of the poor to one
another, a mother’s love, a mother’s pride in her son become priest, a servant’s
fidelity, and various stories of love. All told with delicate feeling and insight.

<p>The story of a girl who, brought up as a peasant, afterwards becomes a

Three parts, each containing five stories or sketches. The first part deals
with North of England life, the second with South of England, the third with

woman dying in the workhouse; 4 and 5, a rural love-story. Studies rather

death in telling the story of her wrongs—she has been an innocent victim of

<p>The plot is concerned with Sidney Bateman, heir of a family that has come
down in the world, his struggles against misfortune, and his eventual attainment
of fortune and happiness. But the chief interest is the kindly, thoughtful
study of character and motive, of human nature in fact, also in the picture of
the ways of the little society (largely clerical, <i>e.g.</i>, the egregious Mr. M’Gosh) of
Culmshire. Lady Culmshire, woman of the world, but with a warm and true
heart within, is the central figure and is a very pleasant, happily drawn
portrait. The Irish interest is (1) the excellent description of the homecoming
of Sidney Bateman to the ancestral castle of Rathvarney, in the wilds of
Kerry, which are well described; (2) the doings of Tim Conroy, a sort of
Mickey Free, and the Leveresque stories told of him by Capt. Howley; (3)

resided, to make enquiries. He puts up at Rathvarney (see <i>Culmshire Folk</i>),
meets Tim and Fr. Walsh (who helps to unravel the mystery), and sees something
of Ireland in the sixties (pp. 240-274). This something, it must be
confessed, is chiefly squalor, described, however, in a humorous and not
unsympathetic way.</p>

<p class="author"><b>GAMBLE, Dr. John.</b> I take the following account of this writer from a
note on him contributed by Mr. A. A. Campbell, of Belfast, to the <span class="smcap">Irish
Book Lover</span> (September, 1909): Dr. Gamble was born in Strabane, Co.
Tyrone, in the early ’seventies of the eighteenth century. He was
educated in Edinburgh. He devoted most of his life to a study of the
people and characteristics of Ulster. He used to make frequent journeys
on foot, or by coach, through the country, chatting with everyone
he met, picking up story and legend and jest, and noting incidents.
All his writings were imbued with a deep sympathy for his fellow-countrymen.
As a vivid picture of the Ulster of his day his books
are invaluable. They did much to produce in England a kindly feeling
for his countrymen. He died in 1831.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ SARSFIELD. Three Vols. 12mo. (<span class="smcap">London</span>). 1814.</p>

<p>The hero is a young Irishman who, under the name of Glisson, is a French
prisoner of war at Strabane. Aided by the daughter of the postmaster he
escapes, and wanders all over Ulster, where the wildest excitement about
the threatened French invasion prevailed. Thence he goes to Scotland,
England, and abroad. He fights with Thurot at the Siege of Carrickfergus,
and eventually returns to Strabane, where he meets with a tragic ending.
The Author embodies in the story many local traditions and much of his own
observation and experience. Well worthy of republication.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ HOWARD. Two Vols. 12mo. (<span class="smcap">London</span>). 1815.</p>

<p>“The subject of the following tale was born in a remote part of Ireland
... my principal character is not altogether an imaginary one.”
The hero of this autobiography is Irish. The scene is London. The central
incident is his seduction of a young lady who after attempting suicide dies
of remorse and chagrin.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ NORTHERN IRISH TALES. Two Vols. 8vo. (<span class="smcap">London</span>). 1818.</p>

<p>“Stanley,” the first tale tells the adventures of a young profligate, son of
a Derry Alderman, chiefly in Dublin. After life of debauch he gets
married, but goes bankrupt. His wife dies, he attempts suicide, is rescued,
and plunges once more into vice. The rest of the story tells of his determined
pursuit of a young lady, ending in a murder for which he is tried and
hanged. It is founded on a romantic episode well known in Ulster, the
courtship and murder of Miss Knox, of Prehen, near Derry, by Macnaughton,
and his subsequent execution for the crime. “Nelson” is a story of the
American Revolutionary War. Vol. II. contains only one tale, “Lesley.”
The hero is a North of Ireland man, whose travels and love adventures on
the Continent and at home are described. The Author indulges in a good
deal of moralizing.</p>

<p>Depicts, with sympathy for the views of the United Irishmen, the state
of Ireland during the years that immediately preceded the rebellion. The
hero is a young surgeon in a N. of Ireland town who is tricked into becoming
a United Irishman, and leads the rebels at Ballynahinch. Under the name
of Dimond the Rev. James Porter is introduced, and many quotations are
made from his satire “Billy Bluff.” Northern dialect very well done.</p>

of Elizabeth, who, for State purposes, wants an English husband for Eileen,
and not till the end are the two lovers united again. The historical setting

<p>Cormac, a youth of Pictish royal blood, has a mission from his dying
father to rescue from the Saxons the mother of his intended bride. His
adventures in carrying out this mission bring him from Damnonia (between
the Yeo and the Axe) to Ireland (Glendalough, Tailltenn, Donegal). He is
present at the half-pagan festival of Beltaine, and at the Convention of
Drumceat. At the latter he meets St. Columba, who is sympathetically
described. The story deals largely with the lingerings of Paganism in Ireland.
Several battles between Saxons and Britons are described. The savage
manners of the time are pictured with realistic vividness. The wild scenes of
adventure follow one another without a pause. Intended for “boys and
others.”</p>

<p>The scene is laid in Kilkenny in 1798 or thereabouts, but both the topographical
and historical settings are of the vaguest—there is very little local
colour, and practically no depiction of historical events, though there is
much about rebellion and secret societies. The story is thoroughly melodramatic:
it has no serious purpose, but the tone is wholesome. The
characters of the story are all represented as Catholics. This Author wrote
upwards of thirty other novels.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE LAST EARL OF DESMOND. Two Vols. (<i>Hodges &amp; Smith</i>).
1854.</p>

<p>Extensive pref., introd. (summarising history of Earls of Desmond), and
notes. Scene: Mallow, various parts of Munster, and the Tower of
London. All the great personages of the time, English and Irish, figure in
the story, but several fictitious characters are introduced, and many fictitious
episodes are throughout the story mingled with the facts of history. The
main plot turns on the Sugán Earl’s love for, and marriage with, Ellen Spenser
(an imaginary daughter of the poet). The bias is strongly anti-Catholic.
Fr. Archer, <span class="allsmcap">S.J.</span>, is the villain of the piece, stopping at no crime to gain his
ends. It is also, though not to the same extent, anti-Irish. He relies for
his facts entirely on <i>Pacata Hibernia</i> (point of view wholly English). The
Irish chiefs are made to speak in vulgar modern-Irish dialect (“iligant,”
“crattur,” “yr sowls to blazes,” &amp;c., &amp;c.). The humour is distinctly
vulgar, as in the case of the Author’s other novel. Raleigh is one of the

<p>Story of Diarmuid MacMurrough’s abduction of the wife of O’Ruairc of

the time. The circles of Lord Edward and Pamela Fitzgerald (centering in
Leinster House), of the Emmet family (at the Casino, Milltown), and of the
Curran family (at the Priory, Rathfarnham) are fully portrayed and neatly
interlinked in private life. The whole romance of Emmet and Sarah Curran
is related. There are many portraits—Charles James Fox, Curran (depicted
as a domestic monster), many men of the Government party, above all,
Emmet. This portrait is not lacking in sympathy, though the theatrical
and inconsiderate character of his aims is insisted on. The whole work
shows considerable power of <i>dramatizing</i> history, and is made distinctly
interesting. “The author,” says Mr. Baker, “tries to be impartial, but cannot
divest himself of an Englishman’s lack of sympathy with Ireland.” The
book is preceded by a valuable list of authorities and sources.</p>

<p>A story dealing with the religious question in Ireland, as seen from a

The hero Howard’s Protestant and anti-Irish prejudices are made to
give way as the real situation of things is forced in on him. The restoration
of Innisfoyle Abbey is one of the main incidents. Some of the incidents
are taken from facts, <i>e.g.</i>, the Rathcormac tithe massacre. These incidents<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
are related with energy and pathos. But in general the story is of a lighter
character, full of broad Irish humour, and placing the sayings and doings
of our Orange fellow-countrymen in a point of view as ludicrous as it is
horrible. “A rambling, spirited, and racy tale, eccentric and even absurd
sometimes, but very original and entertaining.” “This writer is known as
the author of several amusing and clever novels.”—(<i>D. R.</i>).</p>

return there is a successful rising in Ireland, who establishes her independence
by her air fleet. The book is full of politics (Nationalist point of view). An
eviction scene in Donegal—“The Battle of Killynure”—is described. Shrewd

<p>The Cuchulain legends woven into an ordered narrative. The translation
for the most part is taken from texts already published. Lady Gregory has
made her own translation from them, comparing it with translations already
published. “I have fused different versions together and condensed many
passages, and I have left out many.” The narrative is not told in dialect,
but in the idiom of the peasant who speaks in English and thinks in Gaelic.
“I have thought it more natural to tell the stories in the manner of thatched
houses, where I have heard so many legends of Finn, &amp;c. ... than in the
manner of the slated houses where I have not heard them.” The matter also
is often such as the peasant Seanchuidhe might choose; the clear epic flow being
clogged with garbage of the Jack-the-Giant-killer type. Fiona MacLeod
says very well of the style that it is “over cold in its strange sameness of
emotion, a little chill with the chill of studious handicraft,” and speaks elsewhere
of its “monotonous passionlessness” and its “lack of virility.” Yet
to the book as a whole he gives high, if qualified, praise. W. B. Yeats, in his
enthusiastic Preface, speaks of it as perhaps the best book that has ever come
out of Ireland. All these remarks apply also to the following work.</p>

<p>Pronounced the best Irish novel by Aubrey de Vere, Gavan Duffy, and
Justin M’Carthy. Its main interest lies in its being a tragedy of human
passion. The character of Hardress Cregan, the chief actor, is powerfully
and pitilessly analysed. Eily O’Connor is one of the most lovable characters
in fiction. Danny Man, with his dog-like fidelity; Myles, the mountainy
man, simple yet shrewd; Fighting Poll of the Reeks; Hardress Cregan’s
mother, are characters that live in the mind, like the memories of real persons.
There are pictures, too, of the life of the day, the drunken, duelling squireen,
the respectable middle-class Dalys, the manners and ways of the peasantry,
whose quaint, humorous, anecdotal talk is perfectly reproduced, but who are
shown merely from without. The scene is laid partly in Limerick and partly
in Killarney. Dion Boucicault’s drama “The Colleen Bawn” is founded
on this story, which itself is founded on a real murder-trial in which O’Connell
defended the prisoner and which Griffin reported for the press.</p>

<p>Scene: chiefly the territory of the O’Haedha sept on Bantry Bay. The
story deals chiefly with the fortunes of the O’Haedhas, but there are many
digressions. The innumerable ancient Irish names give the book a forbidding
aspect to one unacquainted with the language. The narrative interest is
almost wanting, the chief interest being the laborious and careful picture of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
the life and civilization of the time, the eve of the Danish Invasions. The
archæology occasionally lacks accuracy and authority, but these qualities
are partly supplied in the notes, which are by Eugene O’Curry. The invasion
referred to is an early incursion on the coasts of West Munster by a Danish
chief named Gurmund. Some of the characters are finely drawn, <i>e.g.</i>, the
hero, Elim, and his mother and Duach, the faithful kerne.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ TALES OF THE MUNSTER FESTIVALS. (N.Y.: <i>Pratt</i>). 0.50.</p>

<p>Scene: the wild cliffs and crags of Kerry and West Clare. Theme: the
play of passions as wild and terrible as the scenes; yet there are glimpses
of peasant home-life and hospitality, and many touches of humour. The tales
appeared in three series, 1827, 1829, and 1832. The first (Holland Tide)
contained the <i>Aylmers of Ballyaylmer</i>, a story about a family of small gentry
on the Kerry coast, with many details of smuggling; <i>The Hand and Word</i>,
<i>The Barber of Bantry</i>, with its picture of the Moynahans, a typical middle-class
family, like the Dalys in <i>The Collegians</i>, and several shorter tales. The
second series contains <i>Card-drawing</i>, <i>The Half-Sir</i>, and <i>Suil Dhuv the Coiner</i>,
which deals with the “Palatines” of Limerick. The third series contains
<i>The Rivals</i> and <i>Tracy’s Ambition</i>. These are sensational stories. The first
has an interesting picture of a hedge-school, the second brings out the people’s
sufferings at the hands of “loyalists” and government officials. They contain
several instances of seduction and of elopement. Perhaps the best of
these is <i>Suil Dhuv the Coiner</i>. The characters of the robbers who compose
the coiner’s gang are admirably discriminated, and the passion of remorse
in <i>Suil Dhuv</i> is pictured with a power almost equal to that of <i>The Collegians</i>.</p>

<p class="author"><b>GUINAN, Rev. Joseph.</b> Father Guinan is P.P. of Dromod, in Co. Longford.
Before his appointment to an Irish parish he passed five years in Liverpool.
This gave him “the fresh eye,” the power to see things which,
had he remained in Ireland, he might never have observed. His books
deal with two things—the life of the poorest classes in the Midlands
and the life of the priests. Of both he has intimate personal knowledge,
and for both unbounded admiration. He writes simply and earnestly.
To the critic used only to English literature, his work may seem wanting in
artistic restraint, for he gives free vein to emotion. But this is more
than atoned for by its obvious sincerity.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ SCENES AND SKETCHES IN AN IRISH PARISH; or, Priests

<p>A faithful picture of typical things in Irish life: the Station, the Sunday
Mass, the grinding of landlordism, the agrarian crime, the eviction, the
emigration-wake. See especially the chapter “Sunday in Doon.” This is
the Author’s first novel and is somewhat immature.</p>

<p>The fortunes of a family of four children whose mother is a beautiful and
lovable character. The book is full of pictures of many phases of Irish life,
the relations between landlord and tenant, priests and people, evictions,
emigration, a “spoiled priest.” A typical description is the realistic picture
of the pig fair. Full of true pathos, with an occasional touch of kindly humour.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE ISLAND PARISH. Pp. 331. (<i>Gill</i>). 1908.</p>

<p>The work of an ideal young priest in Ballyvora, a kind of Sleepy Hollow
where all is stagnation, poverty, and decay. The picture of these squalid
conditions of life is one of photographic and unsparing exactness. Yet with
loving insight the Author shows the peasant’s quiet happiness, beauty of soul,
and downright holiness of life in the midst of all this. There is no plot, the
book is a series of pictures loosely strung together. There is a chapter on
Lisdoonvarna.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ DONAL KENNY. (<i>Washbourne</i>). 1910. (N.Y.: <i>Benziger</i>). 1.10.</p>

rapid fall into habits of drink; his own early struggles; his love for Norah
Kenny; his search for traces of her real identity; and the happy ending
of it all. Displays all the Author’s knowledge of Irish life in sketches of

way country parish. He had been very distinguished at Maynooth and
seemed thrown away on such a place as Kilcloon, but he finds that there is
work there worth his doing—temperance to be promoted, the Gaelic League
to be established, industries to be fostered. The story has the same qualities
as the Author’s former books, and in fact differs little from them.</p>

is one of the most active members of the Irish Parliamentary Party.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE OLD KNOWLEDGE. (<i>Macmillan</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1901.</p>

<p>A book quite unique in conception. Into the romance are woven fishing
episodes and cycling episodes and adventures among flowers. There are
exquisite glimpses, too, of Irish home life, and the very spirit of the mists
and loughs and mountains of Donegal is called up before the reader. But
above all there is the mystic conception of Conroy, the Donegal schoolmaster,
whose soul lives with visions, and communes with the spirits of eld, the nature
gods of pagan Ireland.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ JOHN MAXWELL’S MARRIAGE. (<i>Macmillan</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1903.</p>

<p>Scene: chiefly Donegal, <i>c.</i> 1761-1779. A strong and intense story. Interesting
not only for its powerful plot, but for the admirably painted background
of scenery and manners, and for its studies of character. It depicts
in strong colours the tyranny of Protestant colonists and the hate which
it produces in the outcast Catholics. One of the main motives of the story is
a forced marriage of a peculiarly odious kind. In connexion with this marriage
there is one scene in the book that is drawn with a realism which, we
think, makes the book unsuitable for certain classes of readers. The hero
fights on the American side in the war of Independence, and takes a share
in Nationalist schemes at home.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE GLADE IN THE FOREST. Pp. 224. (<i>Maunsel</i>). 1<i>s.</i> Cloth.
1907.</p>

<p>Seven short stories, chiefly about Donegal, five of them dealing with peasant
life, of which the Author writes with intimate and kindly knowledge. “The
Grip of the Land” describes the struggles of a small farmer and the love of
his bleak fields that found no counterpart in his eldest boy, who has his heart
set on emigration. Compare Bazin’s <i>La Terre qui Meurt</i>. All the stories
had previously appeared in such magazines as the <span class="smcap">Cornhill</span> and <span class="smcap">Blackwood’s</span>.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ ROBERT EMMET. (<i>Macmillan</i>). 6<i>s.</i> Map of Dublin in 1803. 1909.</p>

<p>An account of the Emmet rising related with scrupulous fidelity to fact
and in minute detail. The Author introduces no reflections of his own, leaving
the facts to speak. His narrative is graphic and vivid, the style of high
literary value. The minor actors in the drama—Quigley, Russell, Hamilton,
Dwyer—are carefully drawn. Though he gives a prominent place in the story
to Emmet’s romantic love for Sarah Curran, Mr. Gwynn has sought rather to
draw a vivid picture of the event by which the young patriot is known to
history than to reconstruct his personality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p class="author"><b>HALL, Mrs. S. C.</b> Born in Dublin, 1800. Brought by her mother (who
was of French Huguenot descent) to Wexford in 1806. Here she lived,
mixing a good deal with the peasantry, until the age of fifteen, when she
was taken away to London, and did not again return to Wexford. Wrote
nine novels, and many short stories and sketches. Besides the works
noticed here, she and her husband produced between them a very large
number of volumes. See his <i>Reminiscences of a Long Life</i>. Two vols.
London. 1883. A reviewer in <span class="smcap">Blackwood’s</span> describes her work as
“bright with an animated and warm nationality, apologetic and

Cruikshank, &amp;c. [1829]. 1854 (5th), 1892, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hall intends in these sketches to do for her village of Bannow, in
Wexford, what Miss Mitford did for her English village. This district, she
says, “possesses to a very remarkable extent all the moral, social, and natural
advantages, which are to be found throughout the country.” The author
proclaims (cf. Introduction) her intention “so to picture the Irish character
as to make it more justly appreciated ... and more respected in England.”
She applies to the peasantry the saying “their virtues are their own; but
their vices have been forced upon them.” Again she says, “the characters
here are all portraits.” Yet it must be confessed that the standpoint is,
after all, alien, and something strangely like the traditional stage Irishman
appears occasionally in these pages. There is, however, not a shadow of
religious bias. The “Rambling Introduction” makes very pleasant reading.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ LIGHTS AND SHADOWS OF IRISH LIFE. Three vols. (long).

“Sketches on Irish Highways during the Autumn of 1834” (whole of Vol. II.).
3. “Illustrations of Irish Pride” (two stories). 4. “The Dispensation.”
5. “Old Granny.” No. 1 “derives its title from an occurrence ... in ...
Blarney ... about the year 1812.”—(<i>Pref.</i>). It is a thoroughly good story,
telling how Connor in order to win the fair widow Margaret, his early love,
takes an oath against drinking, flirting, and faction-fighting for a year, and
how a vengeful old tramp woman makes him break it on the very last day.
Amusingly satirical portrait of the little Cockney, Peter Swan. Author’s
sympathies thoroughly Irish. Contents of Vol. II.:—“The Jaunting Car,”
“Beggars,” “Naturals,” “Servants,” “Ruins” [or stories told <i>a propos</i>
of them], &amp;c. The dialect is very well done, full of humour and flavour.

<p class="book">⸺ STORIES OF THE IRISH PEASANTRY. Pp. 302, (close print).
(<i>Chambers</i>). [1840]. 1851, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Aims to reconcile landlords and peasantry. To this end tries to show each
to what their enmity is due and how they may remedy the evil. The stories
are to show the peasantry that their present condition is due to defects in
the national character and in the prevailing national habits—chiefly drink,
early marriages, laziness, conservatism, superstition. The Authoress has a
good grasp of the ways of the people, but her reasoning is peculiar. When a
peasant, driven to desperation by a cruel eviction, swears vengeance, this is
put down to innate lawlessness, sinfulness, and a murderous disposition.
Twenty stories in all, some melodramatic, some pastoral.</p>

elaborate spy-system then flourishing, is given, but not so as to interfere with
the interest of the tale. There are fine descriptions of the scenery of Wicklow,
in which the action chiefly takes place, and especially of the Golden Vale
between Bray and Delgany.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ MARRIAGE BONDS; or, Christian Hazell’s Married Life. Pp. 439.
(<i>Ward, Lock</i>). <i>n.d.</i> (1878).</p>

<p>First appeared in <span class="smcap">The Englishwoman’s Domestic Magazine</span>. An unhappy
marriage of a sweet, loving, sensitive nature to a man of a hard, selfish
character, who treats his wife with studied neglect and discourtesy. Christian
comes from her native English manor house to live with Alick Hazell in an
ugly, ill-managed Irish country house, among disagreeable neighbours somewhere
on the S.E. coast of Ireland. He hates the people, and is a bad landlord.
She has no friend until the arrival of his brother Eustace, whose mother
was Irish and who loves Ireland. Almost unawares they fall in love, but
E. is a man of honour, and C. is faithful to her husband to the very end.
The author is on Ireland’s side, though somewhat apologetically and vaguely.
Good picture of bitterly anti-Irish narrow-minded type of minor country
gentry.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ TRUE TO THE CORE: a Romance of ’98. Two Vols. (<i>F. V. White</i>).
1884.</p>

<p>The story of the love of a Kerry peasant girl for the ill-fated John Sheares.
The interest is that of plot, history being quite of minor importance, and
centres in the scheming of his various enemies to compass the destruction
of John Sheares in spite of all the efforts of his guardian angel, Norah Nagle.
There is not one really sympathetic character. Sheares is a mere dreamer;
Norah is generous and faithful, but lies and “barges” on occasion; almost
all the rest, except Norah’s peasant lover, are fools or villains of the blackest
sort. Disagreeable picture of the Dublin of the day. The story is told with
considerable verve and carries one along. The Author is not at all hostile,
but seems unstirred to any feeling of enthusiasm for the cause of Ireland.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ ACROSS AN IRISH BOG. (<i>Heinemann</i>). 1896.</p>

<p>An ugly, but very powerful, tale of seduction in Irish peasant life. The
study of the ignominious aspirations of the seducer, a Protestant clergyman,
after social elevation forms the pith of the book. The difficulty of his position,
technically on a level with the gentry, though he is wholly unequal to them in
breeding, is brought out.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ BEYOND THE BOUNDARY. Pp. 306. (<i>Hurst &amp; Blackett</i>). 1902.</p>

<p>Scene: first in London, afterwards among Ulster peasantry (dialect
cleverly reproduced). Theme: a curiously ill-assorted marriage. Brian
Lindsay, son of Presbyterian Ulster peasants, had during a panic deserted
his men in action. Afterwards he had been decorated mistakenly, instead
of the man who had died to save him. In London he meets this man’s
sister, a solitary working girl, but a lady. They are married, and he takes
her home. Disillusionment on the wife’s part follows, and Brian is threatened
with the discovery of his secret. What came of it all is told in a beautiful
and convincing story. Not gloomy nor morbid. Running through the main
plot is the story of poor little French Pipette, deserted by the foolish, selfish,
mother, whom she adores. Old Lindsay, dour and godly, is very well done.
An element of humour is found in the characters of Miss Arnold of the
venomous tongue; fat little Mr. Leslie, who loves his dinners; and Maggie,
the Lindsay’s maid-of-all-work.</p>

<p>Picture of Dublin society, showing how Catholics are handicapped by their

<p>The Hon. Miss F. is the only daughter of the ancient and broken-down
house of the Darraghmores. The father squanders his income faster than he
gets it, and has to keep moving from place to place, living chiefly on credit.
Miss F. is brought up in this inconsequent, semi-gipsy family, with wild
harum-scarum brothers. The Author does not blink the consequent shortcomings
of the heroine. Amusing things happen when she goes to live with
her maiden aunts at Bath—an unsuccessful experiment. Her choice between
her Irish farmer lover and the admirable English Mr. Satterthwaite—we
shall not reveal. Good minor characters—Cawth, the old servant of the
family; Mr. Perry, the family lawyer. “The Author represents the interiors

<p>A collection of short, witty anecdotes and jokes, four or five to a page.
Source: not indicated, but they are obviously culled from periodicals, or
from previous collections of the kind. A few seem to be taken from serious
biographies. They are given without comment, exactly as he found them,
says the Author (Pref.). They exhibit no religious nor racial bias (witness
the last chapter on Priest and People), but throughout you have the “Paddy”
of the comic paper, and in many places the traditional Stage-Irishman whirls
his shillelagh and “hurroos for ould Oireland” in a wholly impossible brogue.

The Author is not anti-Catholic nor anti-Irish: she is amusingly ignorant
of Catholic matters and is not interested in Ireland. P. 37—a scene of Irish
lawlessness (capture of a private still). P. 40—unpleasant description of a
wake. The plot hinges mainly on the strife in the hero’s mind between his
love for Ellen, the penniless peasant girl, to whom he owes several rescues
from the Shanavests, and the heiress to marry whom would be to save his
father from ruin.</p>

<p>The Author is Lecturer in Celtic language and literature in the University

allusions to Irish folklore and legend. Highly technical in conception and

who finally bring the poor Colonel to his grave. Subsequently it transpires
that Mrs. Connor’s husband was alive all the time, and the Colonel’s nephew
comes into his own. The book is full of the awful crimes of Ribbonism,
and closes thus:—“No statesmanship, no good government will ever deliver

<p class="book">⸺ FATHER ALPHONSUS. Pp. 282. (<i>Unwin</i>). 1898.</p>

<p>The life-story of two young seminarians. One of these, finding he has
no vocation, leaves before ordination, and has no reason to repent the step.
The other, ignoring uneasy feelings that trouble may come of it later, becomes
a priest. Afterwards he meets with a certain lady, a recent convert from
Protestantism. A mutual attachment springs up, and eventually they are
married. The circumstances, as arranged by the novelist, are so strange
as almost to seem to palliate this sin, were it not for his omission of one factor,
viz., that particular form of divine help towards the doing of duty which
Catholics call the <i>gratia status</i>. The erring priest ends his life in a Carthusian
monastery. The tone throughout is almost faultless from a Catholic standpoint.
Indeed, though there are several passionate scenes, rendering the
book unfitted for certain readers, the moral tone is high. Some of the characteristics
of Irish social life are admirably portrayed.</p>

<p>“For several of the incidents related in this story, the Author is indebted
to the narrative of Samuel Riley, a yeoman [Quaker] of Cork, who was captured
by the rebels, while on his way to Dublin, in September, 1798.” This worthy
man discovers the rebels to be very different from what he had taken them to
be. A healthy, breezy tale with more adventure than history. Standpoint:
thoroughly national. There is quiet humour in the quaintly told narrative
of the Quaker. Castlereagh, Major Sirr, Grattan, Lord Enniskillen figure
in the story.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ WHEN LOVE IS KIND. Pp. 320. (<i>Long</i>). 1898.</p>

<p>A wholesome Irish love-story of the present day. The hero, Rupert
Standish, is a soldier and a soldier’s son. The story brings out the comradeship
which may exist between father and son. The page-boy, Peter, with his
gruesome tales, is a curious study. There are many passages descriptive of
scenes and incidents in Ireland.</p>

<p>Period: the days of Grattan’s Parliament, of which a vivid picture is
drawn, and of the viceroyalty of the Duke of Rutland. The interest is

<p>A product of the Home Rule controversy. The Author is a noted anti-Catholic
writer, but he is also a Liberal, and desirous of defending Liberalism
from the charge of seeking to establish Rome Rule in Ireland. Home Rule,
so reads the story, would mean Rome Rule for some years, but would ultimately
lead to the emancipation of the Irish from the thralldom of priestcraft
and dogma. The story tells of Denis who unexpectedly discovers that
he is heir to an Irish estate, and neighbour of Elenore Tyrone, whom he had
seen and loved. A quarrel and the attractions of the beautiful “Fenian,”
Rosaleen, separate the two for a time. The Author clearly knows little or
nothing of Ireland, but he would like to be benevolent in tone to “dear old
beautiful Erin.” By the same Author: <i>Follow the Gleam</i>, <i>The Wilderness</i>,
<i>The Jesuit</i>, <i>The Scarlet Woman</i>, and some thirty other novels.</p>

story itself is full of the spirit of heroism and chivalry. It is selected and
adapted from many sources (indicated in Appendix), and the epic narrative
is not mixed with puerile or absurd episodes. Some of the illustrations are
excellent, others tend, perhaps, too much to quaintness.</p>

<p>Sub-t.:—“A story of love and poverty in Irish peasant life.” The central
figure—almost the only figure in the book—is Anna Gilmore, a poor woman
living in Pogue’s Entry, in the town of Antrim. Brought up as a pious
Catholic by Catholic parents, she marries a Protestant against their wish.
Henceforth she has renounced Catholicism, having chosen, as she says,
love instead of religion. To show that her choice was of the better part
seems to be the purpose of the Author. The book is a lovingly-drawn
portrait, with slight incidents, and the many wise sayings of Anna as traits.
There is a strong evangelical religious atmosphere throughout. The story
is largely in dialect. It is laid in Famine times; yet there are several
mention of Fenians, which seems to spell Catholic. The book would be better
understood by a reading of the Author’s autobiography, <i>From the Bottom Up</i>.</p>

<p>Introd. (by J. Campbell, <span class="allsmcap">M.A., M.D., F.R.C.S., LL.D.</span> (<i>Hon. Causa</i>)) says,
“In writing <i>The Lion’s Whelp</i> Dr. Irvine has set before himself two main
objects. He desires to inculcate on the medical profession the necessity
which exists for the education of the public in all that pertains to the
maintenance of health ... and he wishes to impress upon the public
all that is summed up in the time-worn adage—‘Prevention is better than
cure.’” Incidentally, the book is also a satire against professional make-believe.
Scene varies between Belfast, the North of England, and Denver
City, U.S.A. The hero, Dan Nevin, starts his career as a doctor, with high
ideals—too high, as he discovers, for real life. The story is concerned with
his love-affair and various other adventures. A fine plot, well worked out,
with several striking characters. Moral tone high. Religion scarcely
touched upon. There are interesting descriptions of Co. Down scenery
and of life in Queen’s College, Belfast. The Author is a doctor, practising in

edition. [1891]. Third, 1902.</p>

<p>Eight full-page plates and numerous illustrations in the text by J. D.
Batten. The pictures are exquisite, and could scarcely be more appropriate.
Interesting and valuable Notes and References at end, about 30 pages, giving
the source of each tale and parallels. The tales are drawn mainly from
previous printed collections. The twenty-six tales include some Scotch
and Welsh. Some are hero-tales, as “Deirdre,” and “The Children of
Lir”; some folk-tales; some drolls, <i>i.e.</i>, comic anecdotes of feats of stupidity
or cunning. There are practically no fairy-tales properly so called. The tales
are admirably selected, and are told in simple, straightforward language.</p>

<p>In two parts. Part I. (four short stories) is told in dialect (correctly
rendered) by an old schoolmaster, and relates incidents of the rebellion in
Presbyterian Ulster, in which the narrator’s father had played a part on the
loyalist side. Shows thorough understanding of the political and social
conditions of the time, and is written in evident sympathy with the rebels,
though with no blind partisanship. Part II. (four chapters of a longer

sixty years after. A book of much power and truth.</p>

returns to Ireland in the thick of the agrarian agitation. His agent is shot
by Ribbonmen, who had been previously absolved by the priest. He is an
unsuccessful candidate for Parliament. The election is well described, the

the characters is Rev. Mr. Werd (Dr. Drew, of Belfast). The sister of
Charles’s betrothed is entrapped by a Jesuit, who poses as her guardian, and
immured in a Paris convent, but is released after a lawsuit. There is much

collection of the old Gaelic prose romances that has ever been published in
fair English translation.”—(<i>Pref.</i>). The translations are, as the Author
says, in “simple, plain, homely English.” He has made little or no attempt
to invest them with the glamour of poetry. The text is preceded by some
particulars concerning these tales and their origin, and followed by notes
and a list of proper names. The tales are: “The Fates of the Children of
Lir, Tuireann and Usnach”; “The Voyages of Mailduin and of the Sons of
O’Corra”; “The Pursuit of the Gilla Dacker and of Dermat and Grania”;
“Connla of the Golden Hair”; “Oisin in Tir-na-nOge,” &amp;c. “I would

a legend about Murrough of the Burnings, <i>c.</i> 1663, how Patrick saved the

Barneval of Drimnagh (near Inchicore) by the O’Byrnes. “The House of

the book has many interesting incidents; peasant life is pictured with
knowledge and sympathy. The last year of the agitation for Catholic
Emancipation is the period dealt with. The famous Clare election is described,
and there is a character sketch of Dr. Doyle (“J.K.L.”). It criticised
strongly the Protestant ascendancy and landlord party, dwells upon the doings
of Orangemen and of Whiteboys, and the attempts to reconcile the two
factions.</p>

<p class="author"><b>KENNEDY, Patrick; “Harry Whitney.”</b> Born in Co. Wexford, 1801. In
1823 he removed to Dublin, and for the greater part of his life he kept
a bookshop in Anglesea Street. His sketches of Irish rural life as he
had known it are told with spirit, and with a kind of photographic literalness
and exactness. They are very free from anything objectionable.
Dr. Douglas Hyde, speaking of his folk-lore, says that “many of his
stories appear to be the detritus of genuine Gaelic folk-stories filtered
through an English idiom and much impaired and stunted in the process.
He appears, however, not to have adulterated them very much.” In
the Pref. to <i>Evenings in the Duffrey</i> he says (and the remarks apply to his
other books), “On all other points [viz., than the matrimonial fortunes
of his hero and heroine] there is not a fictitious character, nor incident
in the mere narrative, nor legend related, nor ballad sung, which was
not current in the country half a century since. The fireside discussions
were really held, and the extraordinary fishing and hunting adventures
detailed, as here set down.” He died in 1873.</p>

<p>Into the tissue of a pleasant and touching story of quiet country life in
North-west Wexford the Author has woven a collection of tales, ballads, and
legends, some of which are of high merit. They contain a wealth of information
on local customs and traditions. Incidentally, Irish peasant character
is truthfully painted in all its phases—grave, gay, humorous, and grotesque.
The moral standard is very high throughout. There are many vivid descriptions
of scenery. The whole is told in a simple, pleasant, genial style. The
Author tells us that the chief incidents, circumstances, and fireside conferences
mentioned in the book really occurred.</p>

Many of them are of the kind found in the folk-tales of all nations, but have
an unmistakably Irish (not stage-Irish) savour. Moreover, they are told
with vivacity, quaintness, and sly humour. A good selection, suitable for

Court at St. Germain. She loves the son of Sarsfield, but is forced by circumstances
into a loveless marriage with a noble and chivalrous Frenchman, St.
Amand, whom the king had chosen for her. St. Amand goes off to the wars
(Steenkirk and Landen), and meantime the king pursues Iseult with amorous
attentions. To avoid them she flies to Ireland. Here we get a glimpse of
the Penal days in Co. Clare. All comes right when Iseult comes to love her

a scene of savagery. On his return he is “shot at” and wounded, and
there comes to nurse him a young nun with whom, before her entrance into

life of her cousin Harry Macnamara by a kiss given to Louis XIV. This,
though innocent on her part, was the beginning of her troubles. Her enraged
husband rides post-haste to Versailles to tell Louis what he thinks of him.
St. Armand disappears, and Iseult almost dies of fever; but through a whole

at last. James II., the Duchess of Tyrconnell, and many other
historical persons play a part in the romance.</p>

<p>A story of life among gentlefolk. Scene: near Carlingford and in London.
D.’s mother, of a good but impoverished family, has five daughters on her
hands, and the way in which these are married off, partly owing to her matchmaking
exertions, forms the burden of the story. For the most part it is
a light and vivacious story of social life and flirtations, but an element of
tragedy is introduced in one of the subsidiary love-stories, that of D.’s sister
Kit, who was thus punished for a flirtation carried on with Sir Dermot de
Courcy while his wife was still alive.</p>

the first time that her father not only cares little for her but dislikes her
(her birth had cost her mother’s life). But in the long run she wins his love.
There is a double love story—her own and that of her madcap, slangy, tomboy

in slang to her assistance) in a way that might irritate. There is no repose

<p class="author"><b>KICKHAM, Charles J.</b> B. Mullinahone, Co. Tipperary, 1828. Began early
to write for nationalist papers—<span class="smcap">The Nation</span>, <span class="smcap">The Celt</span>, <span class="smcap">The Irishman</span>,
<span class="smcap">The Irish People</span>. Most of his contributions were verse, but to <span class="smcap">The
Shamrock</span> he contributed his chief novels. He threw himself into
the Fenian movement, was arrested along with John O’Leary, and
sentenced to fourteen years’ penal servitude. His health never recovered
from this period of prison. He died in 1882 at Blackrock, near Dublin.
See the short <i>Life</i> by J. J. Healy, publ. 1915 by Messrs. Duffy. Besides
the novels mentioned below, Kickham wrote the following short stories:—“Poor
Mary Maher” (a sad tale of ’98); “Never Give Up,” “Annie
O’Brien,” “Joe Lonergan’s Trip to the Lower Regions” (Irish life in
the fifties, dealing largely with land troubles); “White Humphrey of
the Grange: A Glimpse of Tipperary fifty years ago”; “Elsie Dhuv”
(a story of ’98, full of incident, much of it humorous). These tales have
been collected for publication in the near future by Mr. William Murphy,
of Blackrock. K. knew thoroughly and loved intensely his own place

of quiet humour.</p>

New ed. 1902.</p>

<p>Kickham’s first story. Contains in germ all the great qualities of <i>Knocknagow</i>.
We feel all through that it is the work of a man of warm, tender,
homely heart—a man born and bred one of the people about whom he writes.
It is a simple and natural tale of love among the small farmer class. Sally
Cavanagh’s tragedy is due to the combined evils of landlordism and emigration.
Some of the saddest aspects of the latter are dwelt upon. The book is quite
free from declamation and moralizing, the events being left to tell their own
sad tale. Perhaps the noblest characters in the book are the Protestant
Mr. and Mrs. Hazlitt. There is no trace of religious bigotry. There are
touches of humour, too—for example, the love affairs of Mr. Mooney and the
inimitable scene between Shawn Gow and his wife.</p>

<p>One of the greatest, if not the greatest, of all Irish novels. Yet it is not
so much a novel as a series of pictures of life in a Tipperary village. We are
introduced to every one of its inhabitants, and learn to love them nearly all
before the end. Everything in the book had been not only seen from without
but <i>lived</i> by the Author. It is full of exquisite little humorous and pathetic
traits. The description of the details of peasant life is quite photographic
in fidelity, yet not wearisome. There is the closest observation of human
nature and of individual peculiarities. It is realism of the best kind. The
incidents related and some of the discussions throw much light on the Land
Question. The Author does not, however, lecture or rant on the subject.
Occasionally there are tracts of middle-class conversation that would, I
believe, be dull for most readers.</p>

<p>Main theme: the fortunes and the sufferings of an Irish family of small
farmers under the old land system. The peasant’s love of home and the
bitter sadness of emigration are brought out in the unfolding of the tale. All
through there runs a love-tale told with the Author’s usual restraint, simplicity,
and delicate analysis of motive. There is a humorous element, too,
amusing bailiffs and policemen furnishing much of it. Constable Sproule
driving home the pigs is capitally done. Rody Flynn is a grand old character,
evidently sketched from life.</p>

<p>A story of the course of true love, in which the lovers are long kept apart
by many untoward happenings. The writer’s sympathies and the characters
of his story are Protestant, yet there is no hostility to Catholics, and one of
the pleasantest characters in the book is Father Mac. One of the minor
incidents of the story is connected with the Fenian conspiracy. The chief
interest of the book lies, perhaps, in the drawing of the lesser characters. In
his delineation of all the English personages the Author is unsparingly caustic.
The book is brightly written; the conversation particularly good; there is
a vein of sarcasm throughout, and plenty of incident. The author evidently
sympathises with Irish grievances, and is proud of his country.</p>

The scene is an inn in a valley somewhere on the South-west coast. The
valley as described bears a strong resemblance to Glengarriff. The story
is eminently sane and natural, reading like a record of real events. It is
full of human interest, and is written in a style unaffected yet charmingly
literary. There are some good portraits—the Protestant Rector, the lovable
Father John, Conn Houlahan, the hero, Old Mr. Jardine, the O’Doherty.
The description of an Irish Sunday is one of the most beautiful in fiction.

<p>A love story of Protestant middle classes. Scene: near the Shannon

Her attitude towards Ireland has been expressed in a fine passage worthy
to be quoted. “Nationalist by sympathy and inclination, but not by
contact or association, and belonging to no particular party or clique she
[the Author] believes in Ireland as the Land of Spiritual Happiness;
as the Land which has kept itself innocent, religious, and vividly individualistic,
in face of the wave of undistinguishable sameness which is
engulfing all national idiosyncrasy, and tends towards becoming the
Esperanto of the soul. Ireland she believes in as the Child-Soul amongst
nations, not to be deceived or bought, but perceiving and desiring with
incorruptible ingenuousness those things which alone make individual,
as well as national life worth while: Faith and Freedom before Subordination
and Sophistication, and the Traffic of the Heart to the Traffic
of the Mart.” Their necessary brevity must give to the following notes
an impression of want of sympathy. They scarcely do full justice to all
the qualities of the books.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE FLAME AND FLOOD. Pp. xii. + 339. (<i>Fisher, Unwin</i>;

<p>A love-story. The lovers marry other people <i>not</i> for love. It is only
the presence of a child that prevents the heroine from leaving her husband for
her lover. There are accordingly curious situations, but nothing positively
immoral in the tone. The story is well constructed. Scene: partly in
Ireland, partly in England.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE THIRD EXPERIMENT. Pp. 300. (<i>Fisher, Unwin</i>). 1904.</p>

<p>The scene is laid amid very low class society in an Irish town. The
interest centres in a young girl who is reared on charity, but finally marries a
fairly respectable tradesman. The personages of the story seem to be
Protestants, but religion is scarcely touched on. The brogue is very thick,
but the stage Irishman humour is absent. There is a persistent attempt to
study types and characters.</p>

into the story, and the heroine ends by marrying one of them.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE STARS BEYOND. Pp. vii. + 375. (<i>Nash</i>). 1907.</p>

<p>A problem novel dealing with an ill-assorted marriage—the wife’s name
(symbolic) is “Vérité,” the husband’s “Virtue”; hence the clash. Religion
enters largely into the book. Types of Irish Protestant clergy. The writer’s
sympathy seems to waver between Catholicism and Protestantism, but
the heroine rejects both. The servants’ talk in conventional brogue.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ IMPERIAL RICHENDA. Pp. 313. (<i>Alston Rivers</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1908.</p>

<p>Scene: a small watering-place near Dublin. A fantastic comedy, somewhat
vulgar in places, but on the whole amusing, abounding as it does in
bright dialogue, and in absurdly comical situations. Some shrewd strokes
of satire are aimed at Dublin Society, and there are piquant sayings on other
subjects. The central figure is a young lady who takes a situation as waitress
in a small hotel. Her character is so equivocal that the book cannot be
recommended for general reading.</p>

<p>Taken down, by the editor, between 1884 and 1898, word for word in Irish
from peasants in Galway (Renvyle), Mayo (Achill), and Donegal (Glencolumbkille
and Malinmore), and translated literally. Interesting introduction
on the origin and sources of folk-lore. At the end are some remarks
on phonetics, which do not show a deep knowledge of the Irish system of
orthography, and specimens of the tales in Irish written phonetically. The
book is primarily for folk-lorists and some naturalistic expressions render it
unsuitable reading for the young. There are eighteen stories in all.</p>

<p>A family story (landlord class) laid first at Deer Park, near Cork, afterwards

<p class="book">⸺ HURRISH. Pp. 342. (<i>Methuen</i>). [1886]. 1902.</p>

<p>Scene: a wild and poverty-stricken district in Clare. A view of the bad
days of the ’eighties by one to whom the Land League stands for “lawlessness
and crime.” The people are depicted as half-savage. The story is a gloomy
one, full of assassinations and the other dark doings of the Land League.
The picture it gives of an Irish mother will jar harshly on the feelings of most
Irishmen. The Irish dialect is all but a caricature. Yet the story met
with an immediate and extraordinary success. In a vol. publ. by Mr.
Gladstone in 1892, <i>Special Aspects of the Irish Question</i>, he says of <i>Hurrish</i>,
“She has made present to her readers, not as an abstract proposition, but as
a living reality, the estrangement of the people of Ireland from the law....
As to the why of this alienation, also, she has her answer (p. 309 of first ed.),
‘The old long-repented sin of the stronger country was the culprit.’ She
thinks there was a sin, a deep sin, and (so I construe her) an inveterate sin,
but a sin now purged by repentance.”</p>

<p class="book">⸺ GRANIA: the Story of an Island. (<i>Smith, Elder</i>). 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
[1892].</p>

<p>A sympathetic picture of life in the Aran Islands, where existence is a struggle
against the elements. There are typical characters, such as Honor, the
saintly and patient, with her eyes on the life beyond, and Grania, young and
impetuous, and longing for joy as she battles with the endless privations of
her stern lot, and the lover, Irish alike in his goodness and in his vices. The
success of this book exceeded even that of <i>Hurrish</i>. Swinburne thought
it “just one of the most exquisite and perfect works of genius in the language”
(in a letter).</p>

<p>Gloomy picture of misery and devastation during the Desmond rebellion.
An English boy escaping from a night attack finds refuge in a Connemara glen
among the native Irish (O’Flaherties), hideous wretches of savage appearance
and uncouth tongue. Then comes a confused account of the melodramatic
struggles of Fitzmaurice and his wild followers against the English, noble,
steady, and civilized. There is a vague impression throughout of an Irish
race without ideals or religion, inevitably losing ground, moved by no impulse
but love of strife and cringing superstition. But the cruelties of the English
at the time are not in any way slurred over.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ TRAITS AND CONFIDENCES. Pp. 272. (<i>Methuen</i>) 6<i>s.</i> 1897.</p>

<p>A volume of stories and sketches, founded for the most part on fact. Some
are autobiographical episodes of childhood. There is an incident of ’98,
an incident of the Land War, and two episodes of Irish history, the story of
Geroit Mor, Earl of Kildare, and that of Art Macmurrough, told in vivid,
romantic style without political bias. Again, there are extremely interesting
“memories” of the Famine of 1846-7. On pages 142-150 is a remarkable
description of Connemara. The story-telling is full of vivacity and
picturesqueness, reminding one of French storytellers, such as Daudet. The
book is filled from first to last with Ireland.</p>

an Englishman named Bunbury, fresh come to Ireland. B. is represented
as an honest, unprejudiced, if somewhat phlegmatic personage. The historic
events are presented with great vividness and vigour. The Authors aim at
painstaking objectivity. On the one side the sufferings of the Catholics
and the harsh treatment of the rebels are painted in strong colours. The
portraits both of the rebel leaders and of the Orangemen are far from
flattering. The narrative is largely based on that written at the time by
Dr. Stock, the excellent Protestant Bishop of Killala. Bunbury is made to
spend some weeks at his palace.</p>

<p>Vol. I. of Irish Saga Library. Elegantly produced in every way. An
English version of Professor Windisch’s German translation of an old Irish
romance from the <i>Book of Leinster</i> (twelfth century). The verse of the
original is translated here into English verse, the prose into prose. “In the
verse-translations endeavour has been made to add nothing to a literal
rendering except scansion and rhyme.”—(Pref.). The tale itself is a kind of
preface to the great Tàin. It is not of very striking merit, but is told in
simple, dignified language. The translation reads very well. A literal
translation of all the poetry is given at the end.</p>

“The Courtship of Fraech”; “The Cattle Spoil of Flidias”; “The Cattle
Spoil of Dartaid”; “The Cattle Spoil of Regamon.” The Preface deals with
Irish Saga literature in general and in particular with the sagas here translated.
Each piece is preceded by a special Introduction dealing with its
sources and character. At the end of Vol. I. (pp. 163-197) are copious notes
explaining difficulties and giving literal translations. At the end of Vol. II.
is a portion of the Text of “The Courtship of Etain,” with interlinear translation.
Elsewhere the Text is not inserted. The book is “an attempt to
give to English readers some of the oldest romances, in English literary forms,
that seem to correspond to the literary forms which were used in Irish to
produce the same effect.”—(Pref.). The translation is partly in prose, partly
in verse. The former is dignified and fully worthy of the subject, literal
and yet in literary English. The verse does not seem to us to reach as high a
level. It is very varied as to metre, yet the poetic spirit seems to be wanting.</p>

<p>N.B.—The theme of “The Courtship of Etain,” though not coarse or
prurient, is such as to render it unfit for the young.</p>

<p>A dreadful story of the conspiracy of a number of preternaturally wicked
and inhuman villains to ruin a young spendthrift baronet, and to compel his
sister to marry one of themselves. The threads of the story are woven with
considerable skill. The tale, a gloomy one throughout, reaches its climax in
a scene of intense and concentrated excitement. The time is the Viceroyalty
of the Earl of Wharton, the story ending in 1710, but, except for the incidental
introduction in one scene of Addison, Swift, and the Viceroy himself, the
events or personages of the time are not touched upon. There are some slight
pictures of the life of the people of the period, but of Ireland there is nothing

the efforts of the hero, an officer in the Jacobite army, to regain possession of
his estates in Tipperary, which are held by the Williamite, Sir Hugh Willoughby,
whose daughter O’Brien loves. There are many minor plots and
subordinate issues, among them the unscrupulous and nearly successful
conspiracy against Sir Hugh. The history is not the main interest, but there
is an account of the causes of Jacobite downfall, descriptions of James’s
Court at Dublin, and a fine description of Aughrim. There are excellent
pictures of scenery, and some skilful though roughly drawn character sketches.

as “stage-Irish” ridicule, but as pure fun. Examples of the latter type:—“Passages
in the Secret History of an Irish Countess” and “A Chapter in

<p>A political skit written from a strongly Tory standpoint, in which the
Author tells us how <i>he</i> would deal with the Irish question. The time is 188-,
yet an imaginary Fenian rebellion is described. Kilkenny falls into the
hands of the enemy, and a bomb is dropped from a balloon on Bodike, a
village in Kilkenny. The whole is wildly improbable, but it is probably
meant to be so.</p>

<p class="author"><b>LEVER, Charles.</b> Born (1806) in Dublin, of English parentage; graduated
at T.C.D. Wrote much for the <span class="smcap">National Magazine</span>, the <span class="smcap">D.U. Magazine</span>,
<span class="smcap">Blackwood’s</span>, the <span class="smcap">Cornhill</span>, &amp;c. Consul in Spezzia, 1858, and
at Trieste, 1867. Here he died in 1872. Is by far the greatest of that
group of writers who, by education and sympathies, are identified with
the English element in Ireland. He was untouched by the Gaelic spirit,
was a Tory in politics, and a Protestant. “His imagination,” says Mr.
Krans, “did not enable him to see with the eyes of the Catholic gentry
or the peasantry. He knew only one class of peasants well—servants
and retainers, and he only knew them on the side they turned out to
their masters. Most of his peasants are more than half stage-Irishmen.”
He had no sympathy with the religious aspirations of Catholics, and his
pictures of their religious life are sometimes offensive. These are his
limitations. On the other hand, his books are invariably clean and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
fresh, free from vulgarity, morbidness, and mere sensationalism. His
first four books overflow with animal spirits, reckless gaiety, and fun.
It has been well remarked by his biographer, W. J. Fitzpatrick, that his
genius was much more French than English. After <i>Hinton</i> he is more
serious, more attentive to plot-weaving, and to careful character-drawing.
His books give a wonderful series of pictures of Irish life from the days of
Grattan’s Parliament to the Famine of 1846. Many of these pictures,
though true to certain aspects of Irish life, create a false impression by
directing the eye almost exclusively to what is grotesque and whimsical.
Lever’s portrait gallery is one of the finest in fiction. It includes the
dashing young soldiers of the earlier books; the comic characters, an
endless series; diplomatists, doctors, lawyers, politicians, usurers,
valetudinarians, aristocrats, typical Irish squires, adventurers, braggarts,
spendthrifts, nearly all definite and convincing. See Art, in <span class="smcap">Blackwood</span>,
Apr., 1862, and in <span class="smcap">Dubl. Rev.</span>, 1872, Vol. 70, p. 379. Also Edmund
Downey’s book, <i>Charles Lever: his Life and Letters</i>. Many of Lever’s
novels were originally published in shilling monthly parts, with two
illustrations by “Phiz” (Hablot K. Browne), and had as great a vogue
as those of Dickens. There have been many editions since by <i>Routledge</i>
(3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>) and <i>Chapman &amp; Hall</i> (2<i>s.</i>), with and without illustrations, but
the finest ever issued is:—</p>

<p class="book">⸺ COMPLETE NOVELS. Edited by the Novelist’s Daughter. Thirty-seven
Vols. (<i>Downey</i>). Publ. £19 18<i>s.</i> Cloth. 1897-9.</p>

<p>The only complete and uniform ed. of Lever. Contains all the original steel
engravings and etchings by “Phiz” and Cruikshank, and many ill. by
Luke Fildes and other artists. Ed. and annotated by means of unpublished
memoranda found among Author’s papers. Lever’s prefaces are printed,
and bibliographical notes appended to each story.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ HARRY LORREQUER. Pp. 380. (N.Y.: <i>Dutton</i>). 1.00. [1839].</p>

<p>The first of Lever’s rollicking military novels. The hero is a dashing
young English officer, who comes to Cork with his regiment, and there passes
through what the Author calls “a mass of incongruous adventures. Such
was our life in Cork, dining, drinking, riding steeplechases, pigeon-shooting,
and tandem-driving.” The book abounds in humorous incidents, and is
packed with good stories and anecdotes. All sorts of Irish characters are
introduced. There are sketches of Catholic clerical life in a vein of burlesque.
The latter part of the story takes the reader to the Continent (various parts
of France and Germany), where we meet Arthur O’Leary, afterwards made
the hero of another story. Mr. Baker describes the book well as “very
Irish in the stagey sense, very unreal.”</p>

<p class="book">⸺ CHARLES O’MALLEY. Pp. 632, close print. (N.Y.: <i>Putnam</i>).
1.00. [1841].</p>

<p>From electioneering, hunting, and duelling with the Galway country gentry,
the scene changes to Trinity, where the hero goes in for roistering, larking, and
general fast living with the wildest scamps in town. Then he gets a commission
in the dragoons, and goes to the Peninsula (p. 147). There he goes
through the whole campaign, and ends by viewing Waterloo from the French
camp. Throughout, the narrative is enlivened by the raciest and spiciest
stories. The native Irish, where they appear, are drawn in broad caricature.
“Major Monsoon” was the portrait of a real personage, and so was the tomboy
Miss “Baby Blake.” “Mickey Free” is the best known of Lever’s farcical
Irish characters.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ JACK HINTON. Pp. 402. (<span class="smcap">Boston</span>: <i>Little, Brown</i>). 5.00. [1843].</p>

<p>Adventures of a young English officer who arrives in Ireland during the
Viceroyalty of the Duke of Grafton. The hero’s Irish experiences include<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
steeplechasing, fox-hunting, “high life” in Dublin, a glimpse of society life
in the Castle, love, duelling, and murder. But Lever wrote the book
to show how Irish character and Irish ways differed wholly from English,
and he represents Hinton as constantly having his prejudiced English eyes
opened with a vengeance. This novel contains some of Lever’s most famous
characters: Corny Delaney, Hinton’s body servant; Mr. and Mrs. Paul
Rooney, parvenu leaders of Dublin society; Father Tom Loftus, Lever’s
idea of the jolly Irish priest; Bob Mahon, the devil-may-care impecunious Irish
gentleman; most of all Tipperary Joe. “For these,” says the Author (Pref.,)
“I had not to call upon imagination.” Tipperary Joe was a real personage.
For the last 100 pages the scene shifts to Spain, France, and Italy.
Throughout, event succeeds event at reckless speed. There are some scenes
of Connaught life, and a fine description of a meeting of “The Monks of the
Screw.”</p>

<p class="book">⸺ TOM BURKE OF “OURS.” Pp. 660. (N.Y.: <i>Dutton</i>). [1844].</p>

<p>The early scenes (150 pp.) of Tom’s life (told throughout in the first person)
take place in Ireland. Lever tells us (Pref.) that he tried to make Tom
intensely Irish before launching him into French life. Tom enlists, but in
consequence of a quarrel with a fatal ending has to fly the country. He goes
to France, then under the First Consul, and joins the army. Military,
civil, and political life at Paris is described with wonderful vividness and
knowledge. These form a background to the exciting and dramatic adventures
and love affairs of the hero. Then there is the Austerlitz campaign
fully described; then life at Paris in 1806. Then the campaign of Jena.
Finally, we have a description of the last campaign that ended with the
abdication at Fontainebleau. The portrait of Napoleon is lifelike and
convincing. Lever throws himself thoroughly into his French scenes.
A pathetic episode is the love of Minette, the Vivandière, for Tom, and her
heroic death at the Bridge of Montereau. Darby the Blast is a character
of the class of Mickey Free and Tipperary Joe, yet quite distinct and original.
The scene near the close where Darby is in the witness-box is a companion
picture to Sam Weller in court, and is one of the best things of its kind in
fiction.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ ARTHUR O’LEARY. Pp. 435. (N.Y.: <i>Dutton</i>). 1.00. [1844].</p>

<p>Rather a collection of stories of adventure than a novel. Lever has
worked into it many of his own experiences in Canada, and also at Göttingen.
There is a good deal about Student life in Germany. Many stories (of the
Napoleonic wars chiefly) are told by the various characters all through the
book. Some contemporary critics thought this the best of Lever’s books.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ ST. PATRICK’S EVE. Pp. 203. (<i>Chapman &amp; Hall</i>). illustr. by
“Phiz.” (N.Y.: <i>Harper</i>). [1845].</p>

<p>A short and somewhat gloomy tale of a period that Lever knew well—the
pestilence of 1832. Scene: borders of Lough Corrib. The life described
is that of the small farmer and the peasant struggling to make ends meet.
Faction-fighting is dealt with in the opening of the tale, and the relations
between landlord and agent and tenantry, at the period, are described with
insight. “When I wrote it, I desired to inculcate the truth that prosperity
has as many duties as adversity has sorrows.” It is far the most national
of Lever’s stories, and there is a depth of feeling and of sympathy in it that
would surprise those acquainted only with <i>Charles O’Malley</i> and <i>Harry
Lorrequer</i>.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE O’DONOGHUE. Pp. 369. (<i>Routledge</i>). [1845].</p>

<p>Scene: Glenflesk (between Macroom and Bantry) and Killarney. Period:
from just before to just after the French expedition to Bantry. The
O’Donoghue, poor and proud, is intended as a type of the decaying Catholic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
gentry of ancient lineage, living in a feudal, half-barbaric splendour, beset by
creditors and bailiffs whom fear of the retainer’s blunderbuss alone kept at a
distance. Mark O’Donoghue, proud, gloomy, passionate, filled with hatred
of the English invader, wears a frieze coat like the peasants, sells horses,
hunts and fishes for a livelihood. He joins the United Irishmen, who are
represented as making an ignoble traffic of conspiracy, and takes part in
Hoche’s attempted invasion. Other characters are: Kate O’Donoghue,
educated abroad; Lanty Lawler, horse-dealer, who supplies plenty of humour;
in particular Sir Marmaduke Travers, a well-meaning but self-sufficient
Englishman, who, knowing nothing of Ireland, makes ludicrous attempts
to better his tenants’ condition. “I was not sorry to show,” says Lever
(Pref.), “that any real and effective good to Ireland must have its base in the
confidence of the people.” For this book Lever was bitterly accused of
Repeal tendencies.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE MARTINS OF CRO’ MARTIN. Pp. 625. (N.Y.: <i>Harper</i>).
1856. [1847].</p>

<p>Scene: chiefly Connemara; the novel opening with a fine picture of the
old-time splendours of Ballynahinch Castle, the seat of the “Martins.” For
awhile the scene shifts to Paris during the Revolution of 1830. The story
illustrates the practical working of the Emancipation Act. Martin is a type
of the ease-loving Irish landlord, “shirking the cares of his estates, with an
immense self-esteem, narrow, obstinate, weak, without ideas, and with
a boundless faith in his own dignity, elegance, and divine right to rule
his tenants” (Krans). Rejected by his tenantry at an election he quits
the country in disgust, leaving them to the mercies of a Scotch agent. Lever
pictures vividly the sufferings of the people both from this evil and from the
cholera, drawing for the latter upon his own experiences when ministering to
cholera patients in Clare. He says of the people that “no words of his
could do justice to the splendid heroism they showed each other in misfortune.”
Mary Martin is one of Lever’s most admirable heroines. There is a fine
study, also, of a young man of the people, son of a small shopkeeper in
Oughterard, who, by his sterling worth, raises himself to the highest positions.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE KNIGHT OF GWYNNE. (<span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>: <i>Peterson</i>). 1847.</p>

<p>A close study, based on considerable knowledge, of the ways and means
adopted by the English Government to destroy the Irish Parliament. Castlereagh
figures in no flattering fashion. Con Heffernan is a type of his unscrupulous
tools. The Knight himself is an engaging portrait of a lovable old
Irish gentleman, frank, high-spirited, courteous, chivalrous. At first placed
in ideal circumstances for the display of all his best qualities, he shows himself
no less noble in meeting adversity. Other notable characters are Bagenal
Daly (a portrait of Beauchamp Bagenal), the villainous attorney Hickman,
and Mr. Dempsey, the story-telling innkeeper. In describing the coasts
of Antrim and Derry and the country about Castlebar and Westport, Lever
draws upon his own experiences.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ ROLAND CASHEL. Pp. 612. [1850]. (N.Y.: <i>Harper</i>). 1849.</p>

<p>Opens with wonderfully vivid and picturesque description of life in the
Republic of Columbia. A harum-scarum young Irish soldier of fortune
almost promises marriage to the daughter of a Columbian adventurer. Then
he learns he is heir to a large property in Ireland, and he immediately returns
there. In Dublin the daughters of his lawyer, Mr. Kennyfeck, and others try
to capture the young heir, but instead he falls in love with a penniless girl.
Then there are exciting and romantic adventures. The villain, Tom Linton,
with the intention of ruining Roland, introduces him to fast society, nearly
implicates him with the young wife of Lord Kilgoff; the Columbian adventurer
turns up to claim him; he is charged with murder; but eventually all is well.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
Lady Kilgoff is an admirably drawn character, as also is the Dean of Drumcondra,
a portrait of Archbishop Whately. In the last chapter there is a
passage which seems to show how Lever realized that the anglicized society
of the Pale is far from being the true Ireland. Incidentally, too, the evils
of landlordism are touched upon.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE DALTONS; or, Three Roads in Life. Pp. 700. (N.Y.: <i>Pratt</i>).
1.50. [1852].</p>

<p>The longest and most elaborate of Lever’s novels. Subject: the careers
of Peter Dalton, an absentee Irish landlord—needy, feckless, selfish,
Micawberish—and his children, on the Continent in Germany, Austria, and
Italy. Some of the leading characters are involved in the Austro-Italian
campaign of 1848, and in the Tuscan Revolution. There is a study—a
flattering one—to Austrian military life, and lively, amusing pictures of
Anglo-Italian life in Florence. A noteworthy character is the Irish Abbé
d’Esmonde, who towards the close of the book takes part in some dramatic
incidents during a visit to Ireland, undertaken in the cause of the Church.
There is in the book a good deal about “priest-craft.”</p>

<p class="book">⸺ MAURICE TIERNAY. (N.Y.: <i>Harper</i>). 1.00. [1852].</p>

<p>Adventures of a young Jacobite exile in many lands, 1793-1809. Opens
with vivid description of “The Terror.” Later Maurice joins the Army
of the Rhine, and then Humbert’s expedition to Ireland. The latter is fully
related, and also the capture and death of Wolfe Tone. After some adventures
in America, the hero returns to Europe, and is in Genoa during its siege by
the Austrians. Taken prisoner by the latter, he escapes and joins Napoleon,
of whose Austrian campaign a brilliant description is given. Napoleon and
some of his great marshals loom large in the story, and the military life of
the period on the Continent is described. But perhaps the best part of the
book is the account of Humbert’s invasion of Ireland.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ CON CREGAN. Pp. 496. (<span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>: <i>Peterson</i>). [1854].</p>

<p>Lever describes his hero as the “Irish Gil Blas.” Born on the borders
of Meath, Cregan goes to Dublin, where he has some exciting experiences,
ending in his being carried off in the yacht of an eccentric baronet. He is
wrecked on an island off the coast of North America. Here he meets a runaway
negro slave, Menelaus Crick, one of the most striking characters in the
book. There follow experiences (tragic and comic) in Quebec, and afterwards
in Texas and Mexico, life in which is described with remarkable vividness
and wealth of colour. At last Cregan returns to Ireland, and marries a
Spanish lady whom he had met in Mexico.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ SIR JASPER CAREW. Pp. 490. (N.Y.: <i>Harper</i>). [1855].</p>

<p>The early part (152 pages) deals with the career of the hero’s father, a
wealthy Irish gentleman of Cromwellian stock, who has estates and copper
and lead mines in Wicklow. He goes to Paris, allies himself by a secret
marriage with the party of the Duke of Orleans, then returns to Ireland,
where he kills a Castle official in a duel, receiving himself a mortal wound.
His widow is deprived of the property, and left in poverty. She retires
to Mayo, with her son, Jaspar. In this part there are elaborate pictures of
politics in the early days of the Irish Parliament, and of the wild, extravagant
social life of the period. Jasper goes to France, is involved in revolutionary
plots, is sent to London as secret agent, and there has interviews with Pitt
and Fox. Finally he returns to Ireland to claim his birthright. The story
is told in the first person, and Lever intended the narrative to reveal the
intimate character of the teller. The book is crammed with adventure.
It was a favourite with the Author.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE FORTUNES OF GLENCORE. Pp. 395. (N.Y.: <i>Pratt</i>).
1.50. [1857].</p>

<p>Intended (<i>see</i> Pref.) as an experiment to bear out (or the contrary) his
conviction that “any skill I possess lies in the delineation of character and
the unravelment of that tangled skein that makes up human motives.”
The scene at first is in a castle on the shores of the Killaries, between Mayo
and Galway; afterwards it is on the Continent. Lord Glencore is a passionate,
proud, soured man, misanthropical and suffering from disease. A
scandal connected with his wife has filled him with hatred and bitterness.
He determines to disown his son, who, after a terrible scene, runs away
from home. The book is largely taken up with the adventures in Italy
and elsewhere of Sir Horace Upton, a distinguished diplomatist and a valetudinarian,
together with the doings and sayings of his follower, Billy Traynor,
formerly poor scholar, hedge-schoolmaster, fiddler, journalist, now unqualified
medical practitioner—a strange character drawn from a real personage.
Many of the characters are cosmopolitan political intriguers. In
the end Lady Glencore’s innocence is established.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ DAVENPORT DUNN. (<span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>: <i>Peterson</i>). 1859.</p>

<p>The astonishing histories of two adventurers. Dunn is an ambitious,
clever man who by shady means lifts himself into a high position as a financier
and launches into immense financial schemes. This character was drawn
from John Sadlier, Junior Lord of the Treasury, who was the associate of Judge
Keogh in “The Pope’s Brass Band,” (so-called) and closed an extraordinary
career by committing suicide on Hampstead Heath. Grog David, a blackleg,
rivals Dunn in another sphere, his sporting cheats being as vast as the other’s
financial swindles. Davis’ high-hearted daughter, Lizzie, is a finely-drawn
character.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ ONE OF THEM. Pp. 420. (N.Y.: <i>Harper</i>). 0.50. (1861).</p>

<p>Scene varies between Florence and the North of Ireland, many of the
incidents described being real experiences of his own gone through in each
of these places. Lever having been asked which of his novels he deemed
best suited for the stage, replied that if a sensation drama were required,
he thought <i>One of Them</i> a good subject. Deals largely with the adventures
on the Continent of a queer type of Irish M.P.; but its outstanding character
is Quackinboss, a droll specimen of Yankee.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ BARRINGTON. (N.Y.: <i>Pratt</i>). 0.50. [1862].</p>

<p>A novel of social and domestic life in the middle classes. Scene: a queer
little inn, “the Fisherman’s Home,” on the banks of the Nore, Co. Kilkenny.
Here the Barringtons live. Among the striking characters are the fire-eating
Major M’Cormack; Dr. Dill, an excellent study of a country medical
man, and his lively daughter, Polly. The interest largely turns on the
disgrace and subsequent vindication of Barrington’s son, George. In this
Lever portrays his own son and his career.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ A DAY’S RIDE. Pp. 396. (N.Y.: <i>Pratt</i>). 1.50. [1863].</p>

<p>The whimsical adventures of Algernon Sydney Potts, only son of a Dublin
apothecary. An extravaganza in the vein of <i>Don Quixote</i>, and quite unlike
Lever’s other works. Potts’s experiences begin in Ireland, but most of them
take place on the Continent.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE DODD FAMILY ABROAD. Pp. 565. (N.Y.: <i>Pratt</i>). 0.50.
[1863-65.]</p>

<p>Humorous adventures on the Continent of an Anglo-Irish family filled
with preposterously false ideas about the manners and customs of the countries
they visit. Told in a series of letters in which the chief personages are made
the unconscious exponents of their own characters, follies, and foibles, each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
character being so contrived as to evoke in the most humorous form the
peculiarities of all the others. There are many acute reflections on Irish life,
especially in the letters of Kenny Dodd to his friend in Bruff (Co. Limerick).
Kenny Dodd is a careful and thoughtful character-study. The Author
considered Kate Dodd to be the true type of Irishwoman. Biddy Cobb,
servant of the Dodds, is one of Lever’s most humorous women characters.
Lever held that he had never written anything equal to “The Dodds.”</p>

<p class="book">⸺ LUTTRELL OF ARRAN. (N.Y.: <i>Pratt</i>). 1.50. [1865].</p>

<p>Opens in Innishmore, Aran Islands, off the coast of Galway. Luttrell, a
proud, morbid man of broken fortunes arrives there with his wife, the daughter
of an Aran peasant. The latter dies, leaving an only son, Harry. Shortly
afterwards Sir Gervais Vyner, a wealthy Englishman, calls at the island in
his yacht, and renews acquaintance with Luttrell. Vyner then goes to
Donegal, where he meets with and adopts a beautiful peasant girl. The
interest turns largely on the success of Vyner’s experiment in making a fine
lady out of the girl. She is one of Lever’s most charming heroines. After
many vicissitudes she comes to Innishmore. Here she meets Harry, who
had returned from an adventurous career at sea, and they are married. Tom
O’Rorke, who keeps an inn in a wild part of Donegal, provides a good deal of
the humour. His inveterate hatred of everything English, his wit and his
audacity (not always commendable), mark him out for special mention.
There is also an amusing American skipper.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ TONY BUTLER. (N.Y.: <i>Pratt</i>). 1.50. [1865].</p>

<p>Scene: partly in North of Ireland, partly on the Continent. Tony gets a
post in the diplomatic service, and has many adventures, strange, humorous,
or stirring. Diplomatic life (Lever was a British Consul abroad for most
of his days) is described with a cunning hand. Some of Tony’s experiences
take place during the Garibaldian war. The most striking figure in the book
is Major M’Caskey, the noisy, swaggering, impudent soldier of fortune. Skeff
Damer, the young diplomat, is also interesting, and Dolly Stewart is a most
pleasing study.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ SIR BROOKE FOSBROOKE. [1866]. (<i>Routledge, &amp;c.</i>). 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
(N.Y.: <i>Harper</i>). 0.50.</p>

<p>“Reproduces much of the humour and frolic of his earlier tales, the mess-room
scene in the officers’ quarters at Dublin, with which the drama opens, recalling
the sprightly comedy of Harry Lorrequer. The vigorous story that follows
contains much more serious characterization and portraiture of real life than
the earlier books.”—(<i>Baker</i>).</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE BRAMLEIGHS OF BISHOP’S FOLLY. (N.Y.: <i>Harper</i>).
0.50. [1868].</p>

<p>Scene of first portion: North of Ireland, near Coleraine, Co. Londonderry;
afterwards Italy. Deals with the experiences of a rich English banker and
his family, who come to Ireland, but the central figure is the selfish old peer,
Viscount Culduff, a neighbouring landowner, on whose estate coal is found.
Much of the novel deals with the exploiting of the Culduff mine. Tom
Cutbill, a bluff, vulgar, humorous engineer, who comes to work this mine,
provides most of the fun, which is scattered through the story. All the
characters are vividly drawn, among others that of a young Irish Protestant
clergyman, the only one that appears prominently in Lever’s pages. The
mystery that runs through the book is kept veiled with great cleverness to
the very end. Finally, the book is packed with witty epigrammatic talk.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ LORD KILGOBBIN. (N.Y.: <i>Harper</i>). 1.00. [1872].</p>

<p>Lever’s last novel. It pictures social and political conditions in Ireland
about 1865, the days of the Fenians. The book is marked by almost nationalist
sympathies, one of the finest characters being Daniel Donogan,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
Fenian Head-Centre and Trinity College student, who while “on his keeping”
is elected M.P. for King’s County. Matthew Kearney, styled locally Lord
Kilgobbin, is a shrewd, good-natured, old-fashioned type of broken-down
Catholic gentility, living in an old castle in King’s County. His daughter
Kate, is a high-spirited, clever, and amiable girl, but the real heroine is the
brilliant Nina Kostalergi, of mixed parentage (the mother Irish, the father a
Greek prince and adventurer), who bewitches in turn Fenians, soldiers,
politicians, and Viceregal officials. A remarkable creation is Joe Atlee, a
kind of Bohemian student of Trinity, cynical, indolent, but miraculously
clever and versatile. It teems with witty talk and dramatic situations.
Throughout there is food for thought about the affairs of Ireland. Has been
illustr. by Luke Fildes (Macmillan). 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p class="book">⸺ GERALD FITZGERALD. (N.Y.: <i>Harper</i>). 0.40. [First ed. in
book form, 1899].</p>

<p>The hero is a legitimate son of the Young Pretender, offspring of a secret
marriage with an Irish lady. Recounts his surprising adventures and his
relations with Mirabeau (whose death is powerfully described), the poet
Alfieri, Madame Roland, the Pretender himself, whose court at Rome is
described, &amp;c., &amp;c. There is little humour, the book being a sober historical
or quasi-historical romance. There are some passages offensive to Catholic

<p>Sixteen stories, many of them artistically constructed, and told with

seduction in rather a light manner.</p>

Joseph Damon. 1912.</p>

<p>Published in U.S.A. by the John Lane Co., N.Y., under the title of <i>The
House of a Thousand Welcomes</i> (price 1.50), this being the name of a boarding
house in New York opened by Mr. and Mrs. Dunleary and their daughter
Didy, who have emigrated from Cork. The story is chiefly concerned with
the lodgers in this house—the eccentric Dr. O’Dowd, a journalist, and the
son of a big landlord in Ireland—all of whom fall in love with Didy. The
last named is successful, and he makes the journalist, a Protestant named
Healy (the remainder of the personages are Catholics), editor of the principal
Irish Unionist paper, which he owns, in order “to make it a message of
peace to all Ireland.” The author avoids religious or political bias, and tells
a merry, good-humoured story.</p>

<p>“Or, A few passages in the life of an Irish rebel.” The hero, descended from
a Williamite soldier, “in every respect the very model of a respectable young
Protestant,” is a clerk in Selskar (Wexford) and in love with Miss Rowan,
socially much above him. An ardent young Irelander, he joins the local
branch and works might and main for the movement. Soon he is “on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
keeping,” but escapes to London. There he marries Miss Rowan. After
many hardships they go to Australia, where he rises to be Premier and is
knighted. Returns, and is made M.P. for Selskar. Reminds one of the
career of Sir C. Gavan Duffy. Splendidly told, the interest never flagging.
Protestant dissenting tea-parties hit off cleverly. The whole atmosphere
of the critical summer of ’48 is reproduced with vividness and fidelity. Dialogue
good and characterisation life-like.</p>

bear this fact in mind. His humour is of the gay, careless, rollicking
type. He is sometimes coarse, but never merely dull. He does not
caricature the Irish character, for his sympathies were strongly Irish;
but wrote to amuse his readers, not to depict Irish life. He was often
accused by his friends of exaggerating the virtues of his countrymen,
and it may be admitted that he sometimes did so. “The chief defect of
his novels,” says Maurice Francis Egan, <i>q.v.</i>, “is that they were written
with an eye on what the English reader would expect the Irish characters
to do.”</p>

<p>Introduction and notes by D. J. O’Donoghue, who considers this to be
Lover’s best long story. A tale of adventure in 1798, with a slight historical

passages of genuine pathos. Tries to prove that the more heinous atrocities

<p>A series of side-splitting misadventures of a comic, blundering Irishman.
Does not pretend to be a picture of real Irish life, yet, though exaggerated, it
is not without truth. Besides Andy’s adventures there are scenes from the
life of the harum-scarum gentry, uproarious dinners, a contested election,
practical jokes. The characters include peasants, duellists, hedge-priests,
hedge-schoolmasters, beggars, and poteen distillers. There is a good deal
of vulgarity.</p>

and of the Young Pretender. Fontenoy, and the ’45 in Scotland, are introduced.
The novel, says the editor, can only be called pseudo-historical.
The writer had but imperfectly mastered the history, and treats it unconvincingly.
The humour is below the author’s usual standard, but the
interest is well sustained. It is coarse and vulgar in parts.</p>

<p>Introductions by the Author and by the editor, D. J. O’Donoghue. A
miscellany consisting chiefly of humorous stories with regular plots. It
contains also some old legends told in comic vein, yarns told by guides and
boatmen, and several serious stories. There is nothing to offend Catholic
feeling. There is a most sympathetic sketch of a priest and a story about
the secret of the confessional that any Catholic might have written. The
peasantry are seen only from outside, though the author mixed much among
them. They are not caricatured, though chiefly comic types are selected.
There is plenty of brogue, faithfully rendered on the whole. The first volume
contains a humorous essay on Street Ballads, with specimens. Lover is at
his best in uproariously laughable stories such us “The Gridiron” and “Paddy
the Sport.”</p>

humourized. The impulse of the Irish literature of their time came
from a class that did not—mainly for political reasons—take the people
seriously, and imagined the country as a humorist’s Arcadia; its passion,
its gloom, its tragedy they knew nothing of. What they did was not wholly
false; they merely magnified an irresponsible type, found oftenest among
boatmen, carmen, and gentlemen’s servants, into the type of a whole nation,
and created the Stage-Irishman.”—(Introd. to <i>Fairy and Folk-tales of the Irish

<p class="book">⸺ MICK McQUAID.</p>

<p>Magazine stories that have never been published in a volume do not come
within the scope of this work. But I think an exception must be made
in this case. The serial or series of serials centering in the character of
Mick McQuaid has made a record in literature. It began in the pages of
the <span class="smcap">Shamrock</span> on Jan. 19th, 1867. With short interruptions it has been
running ever since in the pages of that periodical, and is running still, though
the Author died in 1894. The following are some of the series that appeared:—1.
“M. McQ.’s Conversion,” 1867; 2. “M. McQ., the Evangeliser,”
1868-9; 3. “M. McQ. Under Agent,” 52 chapters, 1869-70; 4. “M. McQ.,
<span class="allsmcap">M.D.</span>,” 28 ch., 1872; 5. “M. McQ., <span class="allsmcap">M.P.</span>,” 51 ch., 1872-3; 6. “M. McQ.,
Solicitor,” 43 ch., 1873-4; 7. “M. McQ.’s Spa,” 91 ch., 1876-8; 8. “M. McQ.,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
Alderman,” 61 ch., 1879-80; 9. “M. McQ., Moneylender,” 47 ch., 1880-1;
10. “M. McQ., Gombeen Man,” 48 ch., 1881-2; 11. “M. McQ.’s Story,”
1884; 12. “M. McQ., Workhouse Master,” 1885; 13. “M. McQ., Sub-Sheriff,”
pt. 1, 47 ch., 1888-9; 14. “M. McQ., Sub-Sheriff,” pt. 2, 1889; 15.
“M. McQ., Stockbroker,” 61 ch., 1889-90; 16. “M. McQ., Removable,” 1890.</p>

<p>The Author himself tired of Mick McQuaid, and tried to put other creations
in the field:—“Dan Donovan,” “Corney Cluskey,” “Japhet Screw,”
“Sir Timothy Mulligan,” and so on. But after a few chapters the readers
invariably demanded “Mick” again, and, if the Author had not new adventures
ready, he had to reproduce the already published adventures.
More than once editors tried to drop the series, but the circulation which was
60,000 fell at once, and “Mick” had to appear again. Apart from their
issue in the <span class="smcap">Shamrock</span> many of “Mick’s” adventures were reproduced in
penny numbers, and sold far and wide. After the Author’s death the
editors simply reproduced the series over again. Harry Furniss began his
artistic career by illustrating <i>Mick McQuaid</i>. Besides <i>Mick McQ.</i> another
humorous series, <i>Darby Darken, P.L.G.</i>, ran in the <span class="smcap">Irish Emerald</span>.</p>

<p>Father O’Callaghan returning from Italy greatly impressed by what he has
seen of the Raffeisen Banking System at work, tries to start a similar system
in Kilboylan. The book is the story of his efforts, difficulties, and final
success. The local types—landlord, strong farmer, miller, publican, schoolmaster,
“pote,” and “chaney merchant” are cleverly hit off, and their
conversation rings true. The book is primarily a lesson in economics, but
the characters are well brought out, and a little love-story runs through the
whole. Miss Lynch also wrote for Sir Charles Gavan Duffy’s “New Irish
Library” a story adapted from the French—<i>A Parish Providence</i>. It was
intended to teach certain economic lessons to Irishmen.</p>

Parnell in the Ladies’ Land League in the eighties. When <span class="smcap">United

was issued there. Mrs. Hinkson says of her,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> “She was one of the few
people I have known who eat, drink, and dream books, and not many
can have given to literature a more passionate delight and devotion.”</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THROUGH TROUBLED WATERS. Pp. 460. (<i>Ward, Lock</i>). 1885.</p>

<p>Scene: chiefly Carantrila House, Dunmore (“Cardene”) near Tuam, Co.
Galway. Opens with an impending lawsuit about the inheritance of “Cardene.”
It is settled by Mrs. St. Leger giving it up to her brother-in-law
for a large sum. Henceforth she plots to get it back for her son. In later
years he comes on a visit to the place. He falls in love with Nora Dillon,
but carries on an innocent flirtation with a peasant girl. He is accused of
seduction, the real culprit being Nora’s brother, and denounced from the
altar. This latter scene is well done. But the truth comes out, and all is
well with Hartley and Nora. The portrait drawn of one of the two priests
introduced is rather satirical, but the tone is Catholic throughout.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ HER MAJESTY’S REBELS. Pp. 488. (<i>Macmillan</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1907.</p>

<p>In a prefatory note the Author tells us that though the career of his hero
resembles that of Charles Stewart Parnell, Connor Desmond is not intended
as a portrait of Parnell. “There is an historical basis for the structure of
the story—not for the persons.” A political novel, written mainly about
the course of national life in Ireland, 1875-1891. The central figure most
obviously reproduces the career and even the personal characteristics of
Parnell, who is well and even sympathetically portrayed. The writer’s
view-point is free, on the whole, from party bias. He is convinced that a
Royal residence in Ireland would be a sure antidote to seditious tendencies.
There is a strong love interest. The Author depicts many scenes of Irish
life among various classes. The hero is “involved in flagitious relations
with several women.”—(<i>Baker</i>, 2).</p>

<p>“O’Donoghue,” the hero, a young Catholic T.C.D. student, is deputed
by the secret societies to shoot a landlord. He escapes at the time, and
has a successful career at the bar, in parliament, and also in love, for he
marries the girl of his choice, a daughter of “Judge Kavanagh,” a bitter
Orangeman. But years afterwards his crime becomes known to some of his
friends, and the discovery kills his wife. The Author is entirely favourable
to the national cause. Parnell is mentioned several times. The central
figure is not O’D., but “Lowry,” a remarkable portrait, probably drawn
from life.</p>

<p>Ireland in Penal times, middle of 18th century (Fontenoy, 1745, is introduced).
Period fairly well illustrated—sufferings of Catholics, tithe-proctors,

<p>Main theme: the love of an English girl for Maurice FitzHugh Tyrone,
an Irish M.P., famous in the House as a clever and insuppressible opponent
of the Government. Much of the story (a complicated one) is concerned
with the efforts of another lover of the Fair Saxon to supplant Tyrone, and
also to get him to violate the conditions of a legacy. The latter are (1) that
Tyrone shall not marry before forty; (2) that he shall not join the Fenians;
(3) that he shall not fight a duel. His efforts meet with a wonderful succession
of alternate success and failure. Incidentally we have glimpses of Fenian
plotting, the Fenian movement being portrayed with little sympathy. The
characters are nearly all insipid or vicious worldlings, drawn in a satirical
and sometimes cynical vein. Such is Mrs. Lorn, the rich American widow,
of fast life. The heroine, and to a certain extent the hero, are exceptions.
The precocious young American, Theodore, is one of the best things in the
book.</p>

<p>Scene: a large Munster town, presumably Cork. Time: the attempted
rising in 1848. The chief interest is the unfolding in action of the various
characters. Some of these are strikingly and distinctively portrayed. The
treatment of the love element is original, the course of true love being smooth
from the start. Here and there are pleasant bits of description. The standpoint
is Catholic and nationalist, but without anti-English feeling, several
of the principal and most admirable characters being English. A happy love
story runs through the book.</p>

only anecdotes that are truly genuine, really humorous, and certainly characteristic

<p>Ten tales collected in district of Duror (Argyllshire) between Summer of

who had them in his boyhood from Donald MacPhie and others. As folk-lore
they are thoroughly reliable and genuine, the Gaelic text given after each
story being written at the narrator’s dictation with painstaking accuracy.
The stories are typical folk-tales—a string of marvellous adventures of some

and extravagant and devoid of moral or other significance beyond the mere

<p class="book">⸺ CHILDREN OF THE DEAD END. Pp. 305. (<i>Herbert Jenkins</i>).
6<i>s.</i> 1914.</p>

<p>“Most of my story is autobiographical.”—(<i>Foreword</i>). It opens in the
Glenties with a faithful picture of the people and their hard life. The scene
then shifts to Scotland and depicts the toils and temptations that beset the
men, and especially the girls, in their sordid and insanitary surroundings.
The hero goes on tramp with “Moleskin Joe,” a philosophic vagabond, finely
described; and the shifts they are put to and the scenes they come through
all bear the mark of truth, as does the wild life led by the navvies at Kinlochleven.
The description of these scenes in a London newspaper led to his
employment on the press. The hero’s love for Norah Ryan is purely and
touchingly delineated, and, save for one unhappy gibe at the P.P., the book is
unobjectionable.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE RAT PIT. Pp. 308. (<i>Jenkins</i>). 1915.</p>

<p>The story of Norah Ryan, the heroine of <i>The Children of the Dead End</i>,
from her childhood in Western Donegal to her death, a woman of the streets,
in a Glasgow slum. A heartrending story from start to finish, with scarcely a
gleam of cheer. The Author has exceptional powers of observation and
gifts of description, and the book is extraordinarily realistic. But the realism
and the sombreness being exclusive, the effect is exaggerated even to falseness.
Farley McKeown is impossibly villainous, the picture of the wake revolting
because undiscerning, Norah’s innocence overdrawn. Yet on the whole
the Author’s claim that it is a transcript from life, life seen and lived by
him, is doubtless well sustained. There are several needless sneers at the
priests, <i>e.g.</i>, p. 286, which is wantonly unpleasant. The Author is not prurient,
but he describes plainly and vividly scenes in Glasgow brothels. Good
picture of the conditions of life of the Irish migratory labourers.</p>

in agrarian outrages as a protest against various abuses. The writer praises
the Presbyterian religion somewhat at the expense of the Catholic. Some
of the incidents related are rather coarse. Includes legends of Carrickfergus,
also a good deal of verse.</p>

<p>Purporting to be “Told by Ruari Macdonald, Redshank and Rebel, The

the west coast from Achill to Limerick. To a dual love story—of Grace
(= Grania Waile) and Richard Burke, Ruari (the hero) and Eva, Grace’s
foster-sister—are added many stirring descriptions of sea-fights and escapes,
sieges and hostings. Historical personages, such as Sir Nicholas Malbie, the

<p class="book">⸺ BY LONE CRAIG LINNIE BURN. Pp. 153. (<i>Unwin</i>). 1900.</p>

<p>“Two series of local stories of the Scoto-Irish folk of Ulster, the chat of
village gossips, character-sketches of doctor, minister, agent, and inn-keeper:
quaint blends of Scottish and Irish traits. Most of the tales of idyllic kind.”—(<i>Baker</i>).
The reviewer in the <span class="smcap">Irish Monthly</span> says of the second of the
above: “It is a wonderfully realistic picture of various grades of social
life in a little country town in the North ... giving amusing glimpses of the
working of practical Presbyterian theology in the rustic middle class....
Leaves on the reader a very remarkable impression of truthfulness and reality.”
In this second novel there is some humour and a good deal of pathos. The
same remarks apply here as to <i>The Auld Meetin’ Hoose Green</i>.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ A BANKER’S LOVE STORY. Pp. 247. (<i>Fisher Unwin</i>). 1901.</p>

<p>The story opens in “the Union Bank, Spindleton” (the Ulster Bank,
Belfast), the various types of bank directors and clerks being cleverly described—the
mischief-making Blake, the jolly Harry Burke, &amp;c. The scene shifts
to “Craig Linnie” (Ballyclare), where George Dixon’s love story begins.
He is transferred to Ballinasloe (good description of the big fair). Through
no fault of his own he comes under a cloud, but eventually matters clear up
and all ends happily. The Author knows his Ulster types thoroughly.</p>

<p>These books of Fiona Macleod’s are, for the most part, shadowy, elusive
dream-poems in prose, wrought into a form of beauty from fragments of
old Gaelic tales heard in the Western isles (where the Author lived for years)
from fishermen and crofters. They are full of the magic of words subtly
woven, of vague mystery, and of nature—wind and sea and sky. He strives
to infuse into his stories the sadder and more mystic aspects of the Gaelic
spirit, as he conceives it. “I have not striven to depict the blither Irish
Celt.” But many of his stories are simply Irish legends, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>The Harping
of Cravetheen</i>. The Author thus describes his work: “In certain sections
are tales of the old Gaelic and Celtic Scandinavian life and mythology;
in others there is a blending of paganism and Christianity; in others again
are tales of the dreaming imagination having their base in old mythology,
or in a kindred mythopæic source.... Many of these tales are of the grey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
wandering wave of the West, and through each goes the wind of the Gaelic
spirit which turns to the dim enchantment of dreams.” On the other hand,
some of these stories deal with life in modern Gaelic Scotland, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>The Mountain
Lovers</i>, which, however poetically told, is after all a tale of seduction.
<i>The Winged Destiny</i>, amid much matter of a different nature, contains several
tales of Gaelic inspiration.</p>

surroundings on his estate of Ballymaclashin. He ceases to haunt the Bath
Club, Piccadilly, and takes to starting carpet factories (<i>The Job</i>). Many
of the incidents are furnished by the difficulties that beset the task owing
to the amateurish innocence of the baronet and the stupidity of his local
helpers. And besides there are the love affairs of Sir Thady and the English
Miss Devereux. The point of view is Anglo-Irish, the “mere” Irish being
regarded <i>de haut en bas</i> as rather impossible, thriftless, poor people, in short,
as a problem to be dealt with philanthropically. The style is easy and
pleasant.</p>

is there a touch of the pathetic. It would be hard to beat “Shan Martin’s

<p>Simple tales of the Donegal peasantry. There is both pathos and humour—the
former deep, and at times poignant; the latter always rich and often
farcical. The Author writes with all the vividness of one who has lived
all he writes about. He has full command of every device of the story-teller,

The stories are folk-tales, told just as the peasantry tell them,
without brogue, but with all the repetitions, humorous extravagances and

<p>In this book one actually seems to have been living among the childlike

Knocknagar, and to have shared its joys and sorrows. Every character
described stands out altogether distinct, old Toal a’Gallagher the sententious;
his wife, Susie of the sharp tongue; their son, Toal the “Vagabone,” with
his wild pranks; the grandiloquent “Masther,” and all the rest. Through
it all runs the simple love story of Dinny O’Friel and Nuala Gildea, companions
from childhood. The book is full of deep, but quiet and restrained,
feeling. The description of the pilgrimage to Lough Derg has much beauty.</p>

“evening’s quiet end.” Some of the remaining stories show the Author’s

<p>A great advance on <i>Misther O’Ryan</i>, <i>q.v.</i> A tragic-comedy of life among
lower middle class people in a small provincial town. The “son of a peasant”
is Clarence Maguire, an obscure young schoolmaster, who in the end comes
in for great wealth and all but wins the daughter of Sir Herbert O’Hara,
an impoverished gentleman. A sub-plot is furnished by the love affairs of
Constable Kerrigan and his determined efforts after promotion. The plot
affords the Author scope for many genuinely humorous scenes, especially
those in the Flanagan family, which are admirably done, and for the clever
portrayal of some of the meaner aspects of human nature—class pride, servility,
the worship of the moneyed man, time serving, &amp;c. The plot largely turns
on an absurd superstition about changelings. This leads to the hideous

in America. Scene: mainly Co. Sligo. Parnell and Biggar are brought
in under assumed names, and are broadly caricatured. The portrayal of
Butt is truer to reality and less marred by bias. The Author is uninformed
and, on the whole, uncomprehending: hence some absurd statements
about things Irish, some objectionable (but evidently unintentionally so)
references to the Catholic Church, and a quite impossible Irish brogue. But

interest lies in the numerous side incidents and digressions which are designed
to portray various phases of the life of the times. Opens and closes at

Jacobite conspiracies, street-rioting, hedge schools, city entertainments,
political discussions, the working of the Penal laws, and historical
personages, such as Primate Stone, Thurot, Prince Charles Edward, Archbishop

The theme is original and striking. The hero, an English soldier, is all his

He resigns his commission rather than risk in a campaign his reputation for
courage. This action brings on him the dreaded imputation of cowardice.
How he redeems his honour is finely told. A delicate soul-study. The

The Author’s sympathies are with the MacDonnells, who were on the English
side at the time. The book has been greatly admired, especially for the
vividness of its historical atmosphere and its poetic and romantic glamour.</p>

<p class="author"><b>MATURIN, Charles Robert.</b> 1782-1824. Born in Dublin, and educated
at Trinity College. Was a clergyman of the Church of Ireland, and
all his life the sworn enemy of Catholicism and of Presbyterianism, both
of which, especially the latter, he treats unsparingly in some of his books.
Besides his novels he wrote tragedies, such as “Bertram,” and bloodcurdling
melodramas, such as “Fredolpho.” In his way of life he
was somewhat of an oddity—the madness of genius, his admirers said—and
this is reflected in his works. “His romances attracted Scott
and Byron, and many critics have given them great though qualified
praise. Bombastic extravagance of language, tangled plots, and impossible
incidents characterize them all. A remarkable eloquence in
descriptions of turbulent passion is his strong point.” Besides the
novels mentioned below, he wrote <i>Melmoth, the Wanderer</i>, generally
considered his masterpiece, and “<i>The Albigenses</i>, his last and best (1824),
which was pronounced by <span class="smcap">Blackwood</span> to be ‘four volumes of vigour,
extravagance, absurdity, and splendour’” (compiled from Krans and
Read). It should be noted that this writer sometimes violates good
morals by indecency. Mr. N. Idman, of Lotsgotan, Helsingfors, Finland,
is at present engaged on a study of M. which he intends to publish. The
1892 ed. of <i>Melmoth</i> contains an introductory memoir of M., a bibliography,
and a criticism of each of his works.</p>

<p>Republ. in “The Romancists’ and Novelists’ Library,” two vols. (<i>Clements</i>),
1839. The original ed. was anon.—by the Author of “Montorio” [<i>i.e.</i>,
“Dennis Jasper Murphy”]. Intended as an exposition of the unhappy
condition of Ireland and as a picture of the life and manners of the time.
The former is soon lost sight of, but the latter is well carried out. The hero
is a strong Nationalist who works wholly for Ireland’s cause. Apart from
this graver purpose, interest is sustained by a succession of exciting incidents
and by good character drawing. There is little plot, a great deal of sentiment,
and a great many disreputable intrigues, without, however, objectionable
details. The scene varies between Dublin and the W. of Ireland—life in the
family of a Protestant landowner and in that of a Catholic feudal chief.
Period, <i>c.</i> 1806-8. The society depicted is that of the aristocratic classes.
Author’s standpoint full of sympathy and even admiration for Ireland,
strongly Protestant (Ch. of I.) and anti-“Roman.”</p>

long torn between the two, but finally goes to Paris with Zaira. There he
deserts her for another. There is a fine description of Z.’s despair. Eva
dies of decline, and de Courcy, repentant, soon follows. “A moral and

<p class="author"><b>MAXWELL, W. Hamilton.</b> 1792-1850. He was a clergyman of the Church
of Ireland, with a parish at Ballagh, in the wilds of Connaught, but was
largely relieved of pastoral duties by the absence of a flock. He divided
his leisure between field sports of all kinds and the writing of books.
<i>Wild Sports of the West</i>, <i>Stories of Waterloo</i>, and <i>The Bivouac</i> were the
most successful of these; they are still much read. He tells a story
capitally, with verve and spirit, and his situations are as exciting as
those of any modern novelist. Maxwell was the first writer of military
novels: he is the forerunner and even the inspirer of Lever. Mr. Baker
describes his <i>Stories of Waterloo</i> as “A farrago of Irish stories, sensational,
with a dash of Hibernian character and local colouring.” This book
is still to be had (Routledge, 2<i>s.</i>), and a new ed. publ. by The Talbot
Press, Dublin (Every Irishman’s Library), and ed. by Lord Dunraven,

the early life of the heroine. A tale of love and wild vengeance. In the

some nice descriptions of Connaught scenery. But for an absurd scene of

<p>The hero is the son of a landlord and ex-soldier living in the South of Ireland.
Beginning with an attack on the castle by local malcontents, Hector and
his man pass through a series of adventures (some of which are described
with considerable “go”), first in Dublin, then in London, and finally in the
Peninsular War under Wellington. Most of the incidents take place amid the
lowest society, and some of them are distinctly coarse. There is no character-drawing
and little or no attempt to picture the life of the period. The military
experiences in Spain form, perhaps, the best part of the book. There is no
sympathy for Ireland, and there are some gibes at Catholicism.</p>

to work out. The chief interest lies in the purpose which was—the author tells
us—to contrast English, as typified in John Bull, to the description of whose
characteristics a whole chapter is devoted, with Celtic character and ideals.
This purpose is manifest throughout the book. There is a set of Irish and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
set of English characters, and within these two sets are types differing widely
from one another. One of the most pronounced types of Irishman is married
to a lady of peculiarly English characteristics, and the resulting ménage
affords the author scope for much dry humour. A romantic episode is just
beginning to develop. The highly-wrought Meredithian style is as distinctive
as in his former books, and there are stray glimpses of the Meredithian
philosophy.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ SONS OF THE SEA KINGS. Pp. 404. (<i>Gill</i>). 6<i>s.</i> Ten illustr.
by J. Carey. 1914.</p>

<p>Based on the Scandinavian sagas—the Burnt Njal, Snorri Sturleson’s
Saga of Olaf, Tryggvesons, the Heimskringla, &amp;c. Iceland is the centre of
these sagas, but Ireland looms in the background, for the hero, Kiartain,
comes of famous Irish-Danish stock. The Authors have vividly realised and
vividly pictured these far times (end of 10th century). The tone and
“atmosphere” of the sagas has been preserved with great fidelity, and the
tale, told in language of much dignity and beauty, is of high dramatic force
and interest. Miss Milligan is well known as poetess, journalist, and
lecturer on Irish subjects. Resides in Bangor, Co. Down.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ ADVENTURES OF AN IRISH GENTLEMAN. Three Vols.
(<i>Colburn &amp; Bentley</i>). 1830.</p>

<p>A very unpleasant book. Only the opening and closing scenes are in Ireland
(neighbourhood of Bantry Bay, Skibbereen, and Tralee), the interval being
filled by adventures in Portugal (where the Inquisition is held up to obloquy),
and in Paris (where Freemasonry is praised and convents vilified). These
adventures are, for the most part, more or less scandalous “love” affairs.
At the outset there is a good deal about Irish disaffection and lawlessness. The
Author seizes every occasion to drag in the confessional, the Pope, &amp;c., and to
inveigh against them.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE JESSAMY BRIDE. (<i>Hutchinson</i>). 6<i>s.</i> (N.Y.: <i>Fenno</i>). 50c.
1897.</p>

<p>The story of the last years and death of Goldsmith, told with all the Author’s
well-known verve. Full of dialogue, witty and lively, yet not merely flashy,
in which Johnson, Burke, Garrick, and other wits and worthies of the day
take part. The central theme is Goldsmith’s attachment to the beautiful
Mary Horneck, called the Jessamy Bride. There is much true pathos in the
story, and not a word that could offend susceptibilities.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ CASTLE OMERAGH. (<i>Constable</i>). 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> (N.Y.: <i>Appleton</i>). 1.50.
1903.</p>

<p>Scene: the West of Ireland (Co. Clare) during Cromwell’s invasion. The
central figures are the Fawcetts, a Protestant planter family, whose sympathies
have become Irish. The eldest son is an officer in the army of O’Neill. The
second, the hero, is literary and unwarlike, and inclined to Quakerism. A
Jesuit friend of the family figures prominently in the story, and is presented
in a very favourable light. The Drogheda massacre and Cromwell’s repulse
at Clonmel are included.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE ORIGINAL WOMAN. Pp. 343. (<i>Hutchinson</i>). 1904.</p>

<p>Thesis: whatever culture may have done for the modern woman, she
reverts to the instincts of the original woman in the crisis of a life-decision.
Scene: first, country house in Galway. The heroine is a typical modern girl
of the best kind. The hero, who is also the villain, is a singularly attractive
personality, the complicated workings of whose mind the Author delights to
analyse. Later the scene changes to Martinique. Here an element of the
supernatural and uncanny enters the story. The style is witty, the character-drawing
very clever.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ CAPTAIN LATYMER. (<i>Cassell</i>). 6<i>s.</i> Also 6<i>d.</i> ed. 1908.</p>

<p>A sequel to <i>Castle Omeragh</i>. The eldest Fawcett is condemned by Cromwell
to the West Indies, but escapes along with the daughter of Hugh O’Neill,
nephew of Owen Roe. There are exciting adventures. The book, as does
<i>Castle Omeragh</i>, gives a faithful picture of the times.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE ULSTERMAN: a Story of To-day. Pp. 323. (<i>Hutchinson</i>).
6<i>s.</i> 1914.</p>

<p>A very candid, plainspoken, and judicious picture of life in North-East
Ulster. Pictures what the <span class="smcap">Times Lit. Suppl.</span> calls “the unsympathetic
materialism, the drab ugliness of a life which finds its chief recreation
in religious strife, and much of its consolation in strong drink.” But dwells
upon the sterling good qualities that go to counterbalance these others.
Opens in a mid-Antrim town on the eve of “the 12th.” Story of a bigoted
Ulster mill-owner whose sons eventually marry into Catholic families of a
lower class. Not political.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE LADY OF THE REEF. Pp. 348. (<i>Hutchinson</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1915.</p>

<p>A young English artist in Paris suddenly inherits a property in North Co.
Down, and arrives to find himself in a puzzling environment. Cleverly
sketched characters are introduced—MacGowan, the pushful attorney, the
excellent parson Gilliland, and the dipsomaniac captain. Then there is a
wreck, a rescue, and enter the “Lady of the Reef.” The sequel tells whether
she accepts the artist or not.—(I.B.L. and <span class="smcap">T. Lit. Suppl.</span>).</p>

<p class="author"><b>MOORE, George.</b> A distinguished poet, novelist, dramatist, and art critic.
Was born in Ireland, 1857, of a Catholic family of Co. Mayo, many of
whose members were distinguished nationalists. He has produced
some twenty books. Much of Mr. Moore’s education has been acquired
in France, with the result that, as Dr. William Barry says, “he is excessively,
provokingly un-English.” At the same time he has little but
scorn for things Irish. He has, as he tells us in <i>Confessions of a Young
Man</i>, abandoned the Catholic Church. He may be said to be at war
with all prevailing types of religion and current codes of morality. His
books bear abundant evidence of the fact. Many of them treat of
most unsavoury topics, and that with naturalistic freedom and absence
of reserve. They were consequently excluded from lending libraries
such as Mudie’s and Smith’s. Many critics rank Mr. Moore very high
as a psychologist and as a critic. An interesting article on him will be
found in G. K. Chesterton’s <i>Heretics</i>. His non-Irish stories include
<i>Evelyn Innes</i>, <i>Sister Theresa</i>, <i>Esther Waters</i>, <i>A Mummer’s Wife</i>, <i>Celibates</i>,
<i>Vain Fortune</i>, <i>A Mere Accident</i>, &amp;c. Within the last two or three years
he has published at intervals three vols. of reminiscences entitled <i>Ave,
Salve, Vale</i>, in which no privacies are respected and which in other respects
resemble his novels.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ A DRAMA IN MUSLIN. Pp. 329. (<i>Vizetelly</i>). 1886.</p>

<p>Period: just before and just after the Phœnix Park murders. Some
attention is given to Land League tyranny before, and coercion after. The
interest centres in a party of girls educated at a convent school at St. Leonard’s,
and their subsequent adventures in Irish society looking for husbands, and
all eventually going to the bad, with two exceptions. Of these latter, one
is a mad missionary and a Protestant, who becomes a Catholic and a nun,
the other is a free-thinker and an authoress, a combination which the Author
considers natural. For the Irish peasant the Author has only disgust. The
picture of a Mass in an Irish chapel (pp. 70-72) would be offensive and painful
to a Catholic. Re-issued as <i>Muslin</i>, 1915.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE UNTILLED FIELD. (<i>Unwin</i>). 6<i>s.</i> (<span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>: <i>Lippincott</i>).
1.50. [1903]. New ed. (<i>Heinemann</i>). 1914.</p>

<p>A series of unconnected sketches of Irish country life, most of which deal
with relations between priests and people—evil effects of religion on the
latter, banishing joy, producing superstition, killing art. In some of the stories
priests are depicted favourably. In the first the subject of the nude in
artist’s models is treated with complete frankness. Another contains
warnings against emigration. Some of the sketches are exquisite; most of
them, religious bias apart, true to life. Has been transl. into Irish under
title <i>An t-Ur Gort</i> by P. O’Sullivan.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE LAKE. Pp. 340. (<i>Heinemann</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1905. (N.Y.:
<i>Appleton</i>). 1.50.</p>

<p>“A vague and inchoate novel with some passionate and delightful descriptions
of Nature. The theme, very indecisively worked out, is that of a
young priest’s rebellion against celibacy, stimulated by the attractions of a
girl whom he drove from the parish because she had gone wrong.”—(<i>Baker</i>).
Scene: Connaught and Kilronan Abbey. The story seems meant to uphold
the purely Hedonistic view of life.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE FAMILY OF GLENCARRA: a Tale of the Irish Rebellion.
Pp. 154. (<i>Bath</i>). Six illustr. of little value. <i>n.d.</i> (1858).</p>

<p>Ninety-eight (Humbert’s Invasion) seen from the standpoint of the “Irish
Society” (a proselytising organisation). The book is intended to set forth
“the ignorance and degradation peculiar to the Romish districts of Ireland,”
and tells how Aileen who was engaged to one of the rebels (a murderer) is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
converted, and endeavours to convert others, with varying success. The
book is full of calumnies against, and grotesque misrepresentations of, the
Catholic Church. It closes with an appeal to the “Daughters of England”
for funds for the Irish Society.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ TOM O’KELLY. Pp. 232. (<i>Duffy</i>). 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> 1905.</p>

<p>An ugly picture of lower middle class life in a small Irish provincial town.
It depicts the vulgarity and shoneenism of this class, its drunkenness, its
efforts to imitate the well-to-do Protestant better classes, &amp;c., &amp;c. Unsparing
ridicule is showered upon Nationalist politics and politicians. The
unpleasantness of the picture is somewhat relieved by the doings of Tom
O’Kelly and the juvenile Ballytowners. Very slight plot.</p>

a two-column review to the book, written by an old participator in the Fenian
movement (we understand that the writer was the late J. F. X. O’Brien, <span class="allsmcap">M.P.</span>),

“Mr. Moran has done much good work as a publisher of Irish books in Aberdeen.

<p class="author"><b>MORGAN, Lady.</b> She was the daughter of a poor Dublin actor, named
Owenson, and was born in 1777. Her self-reliance, gaiety, and accomplishments
won her a prominent place in the literary and social life of
Dublin. She married Sir T. C. Morgan, physician to the Lord Lieutenant.
She protests energetically in her books against the religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
and political grievances of Ireland. “Her books are a sign of the
growth of a broader spirit of Irish nationality and reflect the growing
interest in Irish history and antiquities.”—(<i>Krans</i>). She is said to have
published more than seventy volumes. Her satires of the higher social
life of Dublin are spirited and readable even to-day, but their tone is
often sharp and bad-tempered. She caught well the outward drolleries
of the lower classes: postillions, innkeepers, Dublin porters, &amp;c.; but
she seldom looks beneath the surface. It has been well said that her
novels are “thoroughly Irish in matter, in character, in their dry humour,
and cutting sarcasm; no less than in their vehemence and impetuosity of
feeling.” Twenty-two of her works are mentioned by Allibone. She
died in 1859.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ ST. CLAIR; or, the Heiress of Desmond. [1803]. 1807, 1812.</p>

<p>“<i>St. Clair</i>, in sentiment and situation a weak imitation of Werter, introduces
an Irish antiquary, who discourses upon local legends and traditions,
ancient Irish MSS., and Celtic history, poetry, and music.”—(<i>Krans</i>). Aims
at upsetting the notion of the possibility of platonic love between the sexes
without any approach to real attachment. Into the description of places
and scenes the Authoress worked much of her Connaught experience.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE WILD IRISH GIRL. [1806]. (N.Y.: <i>Haverty</i>). 1.50.
(<i>Routledge</i>). <i>n.d.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>A love story of almost gushing sentiment. The scene is the barony of
Tirerragh, in Sligo (where the book was actually written). Here the “Prince”
of Inismore, though fallen on evil days, still keeps up all the old customs of
the chieftains, his ancestors. He wears the old dress, uses the old salutations,
has his harper and his shanachie, &amp;c. His daughter, Glorvina, is the almost
ethereal heroine. The personages of the book frequently converse about
ancient Irish history, legend, music, ornaments, weapons, and costumes.
There is much acute political discussion and argument in the book. It is
fervently on the side of Irish nationality. “Father John” is a fine character
modelled on the then Dean of Sligo. It contains many other portraits drawn
from real life. Its success at the time was enormous. In two years it passed
through seven editions.—(Fitzpatrick, Krans, &amp;c.).</p>

<p class="book">⸺ O’DONNEL. Pp. 288. (<i>Downey</i>). 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> [1814]. 1895.</p>

<p>The central figure of this tale is a scion of the O’Donnells of Tyrconnell,
proud, courteous, travelled, who has fought in the armies of Austria and of
France, and finally that of England. He is a type of the old Catholic nobility,
and his story is made to illustrate the working of the Penal laws.
Nearly all the personages of the story are people of fashion, mostly titled.
There is much elaborate character-study, and not a little social satire. The
native Irish of the lower orders appear in the person of M’Rory alone, a
humorous faithful old retainer, whose conversation is full of bulls. Lady
Singleton, the meddling, showy, flippantly talkative woman of fashion, and
Mr. Dexter, the obsequious, a West Briton of those days, are well drawn.
The main purpose of the book, says the Author, was to exhibit Catholic
disabilities. There are interesting descriptions of scenery along the Antrim
coast and in Donegal. As fiction it is slow reading, yet Sir Walter Scott
speaks highly of it.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ FLORENCE MACARTHY. (N.Y.: <i>Sadlier</i>). 1.50. 1816.</p>

<p>Combines, as so many of Lady Morgan’s books do, political satire with a
romantic love tale. A kidnapped heir asserts his claim to a peerage and
estates and unwittingly woos the romantic Florence, to whom he had been
betrothed in his youth. Mr. Fitzpatrick calls the book “an exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
interesting and erudite novel,” and tells us how, before attempting it, she
had “saturated her memory with a large amount of reading which bore upon
the subject of it.” The character of Counsellor Con Crawley constitutes a
bitter attack on Lady Morgan’s unscrupulous enemy, John Wilson Croker.
The half-mad schoolmaster, Terence Oge O’Leary, is a curious type.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE O’BRIENS AND O’FLAHERTYS. Three eds. in one year.
[1827]. (N.Y.: <i>Haverty</i>).</p>

<p>May be said to have for its object Catholic Emancipation, yet the author
was no admirer of O’Connell, and in this book keen strokes of satire are aimed
at the Jesuits, and even at the Pope. Mr. Fitzpatrick says that “though
professedly a fiction it is really a work of some historical importance, and
may be safely consulted in many of the details by statistic or historic writers.”
He tells us also that it “contains a few coarse expressions; and, in common
with its predecessors, exhibits a somewhat inconsistent love for republicanism
and aristocracy.” The novel is the story of a young patriot who, expelled
from Trinity College along with Robert Emmet and others, becomes a volunteer
and a United Irishman, and is admitted to the councils of Tone, Napper
Tandy, Rowan, and the rest. After ’98 (which is not described in detail) he
goes to France, where he rises to be a General, and marries the heroine. The
book depicts with vividness and fidelity the manners of the time (hence the
occasional coarseness). There are lively descriptions of Castle society in
the days of the Duke of Rutland. Lord Walter Fitzgerald was the original
of “Lord Walter Fitzwalter.”</p>

<p>Prefatory notice signed by “John O’Brien Grant,” of Kilnaflesk, the teller
of the story. K. is “situated in a remote corner of the kingdom,” near
Bandon (vol. II., p. 186); it is an old rambling family mansion, dating from

The hero, refused by his nurse’s daughter Mary, has a “go” at a rich heiress,
merely to better himself. He also, in company with Morrough O’Driscoll,
a “restless, blustering, dexterous, successful, ambitious, amusing and farcical
genius,” throws himself into politics. Then there are a number of burlesque
electioneering scenes. Duly elected, the hero goes to Dublin, meets Charlemont,
&amp;c., in high society. Hero marries Mary after all; then, on her death,
rescues an heiress and marries her.... A third matrimonial venture is unsuccessful.

<p class="author"><b>MULHOLLAND, Rosa; Lady Gilbert.</b> Born in Belfast, about 1855. She
spent some years in a remote mountainous part of the West of Ireland.
Of the rest of her life most has been passed in Ireland, where she still
lives. In her early literary life she received much help and encouragement
from Dickens, who highly valued her work. She has written
much poetry of high literary quality and “marked by a thought and
diction peculiar to herself.”—(<span class="smcap">Irish Lit.</span>). Her novels are intensely
Catholic, though without anti-Protestant feeling, and intensely national.
But their most striking quality is a literary style of singular purity and
grace, and a quiet beauty very different from the flash and rattle of
much recent writing. She has publ. several vols. of verse. Among her
non-Irish novels may be mentioned <i>The Late Miss Hollingford</i>, <i>The
Squire’s Granddaughter</i>, <i>The Haunted Organist</i>. Lady Gilbert has also
written many children’s stories full of originality and playful fancy.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ DUNMARA. By “Ruth Murray.” Three Vols. (<i>Smith, Elder</i>). 1864.</p>

<p>Wrecked on the coast Ellen, of mysterious antecedents, is taken into the
family of Mr. Aungier, or Dunmara Castle, in the West. Strange household—the
half-witted Miss Rowena, the dark, vindictive Miss Elswitha, with
unpleasant family history in the background. A will is discovered making
Ellen heiress of Dunmara, but revealing to her that she is the daughter of a
man formerly slain by Mr. Aungier, who had asked her in marriage. This
long keeps the two apart, but they are married in the end. Little Irish
colour. Written in somewhat strained style and at times over-emotional.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ HESTER’S HISTORY. Pp. 237. (<i>Chapman &amp; Hall</i>). 1869.</p>

<p>Pastoral life in the Glens of Antrim at the time of the Union, the main
theme being a love story. Humour and tragedy alternate. Incidents of
the rebellion of ’98, including an attack on a castle in the Glens by the English
soldiery. Some historical characters are introduced. During part of the
action the scene shifts to London. The story was written at the request of
Charles Dickens, and he thought highly of it.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ ELDERGOWAN; and Other Tales (three). (<i>Marcus Ward</i>). Illustr.
1874.</p>

<p>“Eldergowan” is a very careful and clever study of a girl’s varying moods.
“It is an excellent example of artistic work and perfect in its way.” “Mrs.
Archie” is a comedy in which the chief actors are the antiquated family of the
MacArthurs, dwelling in the glens of Antrim. The third story, “Little Peg
O’Shaughnessy” is written in a lively style, with plenty of interest of a
healthy “real” kind.—(I.M.).</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE WILD BIRDS OF KILLEEVY. Pp. 311. (<i>Burns &amp; Oates</i>).
(N.Y.: <i>Benziger</i>). 1.10. [1883].</p>

<p>An exquisite little tale, not of the realistic sort, but sweet and ideal. Kevin
and Fanchea are little peasant playmates together in Killeevy. Kevin is
dull at his books, but full of the love of nature. Fanchea is a fairy with a
bird-like voice. One day she is stolen by gipsies, then by strange fortune
gets into the upper stratum of society. Kevin goes out into the world to
look for her. He gets education and becomes a poet. After long years they
meet again and all is well. Killeevy is an Irish-speaking district where the
people treasure religiously their Irish MSS. Here and there there are pen-pictures
of much beauty. It is not of course a mere children’s book. It has
been well said of the book: “It is our own world after all, seen through the
crystal of pure language, artistic sense, and joyous perception of natural
beauty.”</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE WALKING TREES; and Other Tales. Pp. 256. (<i>Gill</i>). 1885.</p>

<p>Contains “The Girl from under the Lake,” an Irish fairy tale, occupying

<p class="book">⸺ MARCELLA GRACE: an Irish Novel. (<i>Kegan, Paul</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1886.</p>

<p>A story with an elaborate plot, full of dramatic incident. Incidentally
the evils of landlordism and Fenianism are dwelt upon, the former in the
picture drawn of the hovels, the starved land, and the meek misery of the
people—and here the author is at her best. The minor characters are clearly
and sympathetically drawn, evidently from life. There is much sadness and
even tragedy in the story. The Phœnix Park Murders are touched upon.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ A FAIR EMIGRANT. Pp. 370. (<i>Kegan, Paul</i>). 2<i>s.</i>, &amp;c. [1889].
New ed., 1896, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Period: about the ’seventies. Scene: at first in America (farming life),
then in Ireland, north coast of Antrim. A love story. The heroine, one of
those whom all must love, is an only daughter, whose mission in life is to clear
her dead father’s reputation. Full of romantic incident. There is a picture
of the landlord class of the time, and there are many good things about the
vexed economic and social questions of the day. The book has the Author’s
usual grace of diction, sincerity of thought, and fine descriptions of scenery.
It was very highly praised in Irish, English, and Scotch literary journals.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ NANNO. Pp. 287. (<i>Grant Richards</i>). 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> 1899.</p>

<p>A rural love-story. Scene: Dublin and Youghal and Ardmore. The
heroine is a girl born in the workhouse, who is saved from its dangerous and
degrading atmosphere, and raised, by true affection and by living among
good country people, to high moral feeling and purpose and to the heights of
self-sacrifice. The most realistic and the strongest of Lady Gilbert’s works.
Esteemed by the literary critics and by herself to be the best of her novels.
It is based on facts, and it occasioned the reform of certain abuses in workhouses.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ ONORA. Pp. 354. (<i>Grant Richards</i>). 1900.</p>

<p>A story of country life in Waterford in the days of the Land League. Eviction
scenes. Life in Land League huts on the Ponsonby Estate. Has a strong
emotional interest, with much study of the family affections and of the interplay
of character. Many touches of humour. Highly praised in English
literary reviews. Incidentally there are glimpses of Mount Melleray and
of the scenery on the Blackwater. The sterling goodness of obscure people
is rendered with womanly sympathy. Interwoven with the main story is
that of Norah’s little lame poet brother Deelan, a pathetic episode. Also
folk-tales and ballads.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE TRAGEDY OF CHRIS: The Story of a Dublin Flower-Girl.
(<i>Sands</i>). [1903]. Second ed., 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> 1914.</p>

<p>Sheelia, the little workhouse girl, is boarded out with Mary Ellen Brady,
and lives a happy life with her in her cottage in the fold of the hills. But
Mary Ellen dies, and Sheelia, to escape dependence on the worthless cousins
of her dead “Mammy,” runs away to Dublin. Here she is friendless and
penniless till she becomes a flower-girl under the tutorship of Chris. Tragedy
comes when Chris disappears (she had been decoyed away to London and
made a “white slave”), and Sheelia makes it her life work to find her again.
She does so, but in the saddest circumstances. The pitiful story is told with
perfect delicacy. Scene: Dublin, various other parts of Ireland, and London.</p>

<p>Maisie, aged eighteen, comes from Rome to take charge of a whole family
of step-brothers and sisters. She owns an island off the West coast. The
family goes there. The children, after many vicissitudes, turn out clever,
develope special aptitudes, and put these to use in helping the poor islanders
in various ways. There is a pretty love-story towards the close.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ COUSIN SARA. Pp. 399. (<i>Blackie</i>). 6<i>s.</i> Eight fine illustr. by Frances
Ewan. 1908.</p>

<p>An ideal love-story woven into a strong plot. There is tragedy and humour
with touches of heroism. High ideals are set forth. The scene varies between
the North of Ireland, Italy, and London. The central idea of the story is
this: Sara’s father, a retired soldier, has a talent for the invention of
machinery. One of his inventions is stolen, and then patented by one whom
he had trusted. Then Sara shows her true worth.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ A GIRL’S IDEAL. Pp. 399. (<i>Blackie</i>). Bound in solid gift-book

<p>Tells how an Irish-American girl comes to Ireland to spend a huge fortune
to the greatest advantage of her country. There is also a love interest. Incidentally
there is a description of the Dublin Horse Show; a number of folklore
tales are told by Duncie, and there are good descriptions of Connaught
scenery. The book is rather crowded with somewhat characterless personages,
and there are improbabilities not a few.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE GIRLS OF BANSHEE CASTLE. Pp. 384. (<i>Blackie</i>). 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
Illustr. by John Bacon. <i>n.d.</i></p>

<p>Three girls, brought up in poverty by a governess in London, migrate to
Galway to occupy the castle, pending the discovery of the missing heir. The
latter turns up, but is not what he was thought to be, and there are complications.
The girls hear a great deal of folk-lore and legend from the servants
and from the peasantry.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ CYNTHIA’S BONNET SHOP. (<i>Blackie</i>). 5<i>s.</i> Eight illustr. by G.

<p>“Cynthia, daughter of an impoverished Connaught family, wants to

<p>Illustrated by twelve exceptionally good photos of Irish scenery and types.
Scene: near Killarney. The girl comes back from the States to find her lover
in jail, into which he had been thrown owing to the perjury and treachery
of some of the police. We shall not reveal the sequel. The story is told with
a simplicity and restraint which render the pathos all the more telling. It is
faithful to reality, deeply Catholic, and wholly on the side of the peasantry,
of whose situation under iniquitous laws a picture is drawn which can only
be described as exasperating.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE WICKED WOODS. Pp. 373. (<i>Burns &amp; Oates</i>). New ed. 1909.</p>

<p>The hero is a scion of a family in which a curse, uttered against one of
its founders by poor peasants whom he had dispossessed, had worked ruin for
many generations. He is wholly unlike his ancestors, yet he, too, in a strange
and tragic manner, falls under the influence of the curse—for a time. The
story tells how he escapes from the terrible trial. Incidentally the best
qualities of the peasantry are beautifully shown forth, especially the charity
of the poor to one another.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE O’SHAUGHNESSY GIRLS. Pp. 383. (<i>Blackie</i>). 6<i>s.</i> Eight
pleasant half-tone ill. by G. Demain Hammond. (N.Y.: <i>Benziger</i>). 1.50.
1910.</p>

<p>Scene: partly in London, partly by the Blackwater, in Munster, where
live Lady Sibyl O’Shaughnessy and her two unmarried daughters. Of these
latter, Lavender lives at home, takes an interest in things Gaelic, and has
fireside ceilidhes. The other, Bell, runs away and goes on the stage. The
search for Bell and the discovery of the identity of a mysterious boy on the
O’S. farm constitute the main incidents of a delightful story. There is a
love interest. The moral of the whole (not too obtrusive) is “Do the work
that’s nearest, though it’s dull at times.”</p>

<p>Father T. is a zealous curate, first in a Dublin mountain parish, afterwards
in a parish among the Dublin slums. The interest centres in his influence and
work among upper and lower classes alike. The story tells, too, of the varying
fortunes of other people that come into his life. Harrowing pictures are
drawn of the Dublin slums. Written with the Author’s habitual literary
charm. The plot is slight, but the incidents follow one another rapidly
and the interest does not flag.</p>

<p>A melodramatic story, full of hairbreadth escapes, related with a good deal
of dash, and at times of power. Tells of Tone’s negotiations in Paris leading
to the various attempted French invasions of Ireland, with a detailed and
vivid account of that in which Admiral Bompart was defeated in Lough

<p>The story opens on Christmas Eve, 1797, and ends with the battle of Ross,
including very stirring descriptions of the battle there and at Oulart. As is
usual with this Author, the plot is somewhat loose, there are improbabilities,
and the love interest is of a stereotyped kind; yet the reader is carried along
by the quick succession of exciting incident. Of course the standpoint is
national. A good idea is given of the state of the country at the time.</p>

<p>Has the usual qualities of this Author’s stories: plenty of exciting and
dramatic incident, and stirring descriptions—among the latter the battle
of Camperdown. Deals with Wolfe Tone’s efforts to obtain aid from France
for the United Irishmen and with the plans of the latter at home. Lord
Edward Fitzgerald and Oliver Bond appear. There are pictures, too, of the
atrocities of the yeomanry. Interwoven with these events there is a romance
of private life centering in the cleverly drawn characters of Teague, the
Fiddler, and Kate Hatchman. As usual, the Author makes much use of
“the long arm of coincidence.”</p>

<p>A sensational story, filled, without any interval of dullness, with exciting
adventures—sea battles, wrecks, hairbreadth escapes, fighting under Wellington

land agent in Ireland—Malcolm M’Nab—and of which Luke is suspected on
strong circumstantial evidence. All through the book, until just the end,
M’Nab is on top, but right finally triumphs. There is no attempt at character

<p class="book">⸺ LLOYD PENNANT: a Tale of the West. Two Vols. (<i>Chapman &amp;
Hall</i>). 1864.</p>

<p>First ran as a serial in “Duffy’s Hibernian Magazine,” 1863. Well-written
and exciting melodrama, with a good plot, but very quiet and plain in style.
The hero, who bears an assumed name, and is really heir of an old Anglo-Irish
family, joins the British navy. He is unjustly accused of disloyalty and
intimacy with Lord Edward Fitzgerald. But all ends well, including his
love affair with Kate Blake, daughter of a family that plays a principal part
in the story. The Humbert invasion is touched upon, especially the Castlebar
“Races.” There is a good deal about the ways of gombeen men and middlemen
in the West. Sympathies national. Wrote also <i>The Squire’s Heir</i>, 1881.</p>

<p>The life and doings of Cicely Grattan and of her adopted son Victor La
Roche, a noble and generous youth, brave and skilled in sword-play—examples
respectively of womanly virtue and manly character. The interest centres
chiefly in Cicely’s wrecked love affairs and in Victor’s successful ones. Abundance
of incident sustains the interest throughout, and the book gives a
fairly good picture of society in the Dublin of the day, with not a little reference
to its loose morals.</p>

<p>Three little stories, only the last of which has a definite plot, and a poem.
They deal with peasant life. They are told in a dialect which is not very
sure of itself nor very true to reality. The nine little illustrations by J. E.
Corr and the excellent printing and general get-up make the book very dainty.</p>

<p>Three stories:—1. “The O’Donol (<i>sic</i>) Rent,” 1879-80; 2. “Rosie,”
1885; 3. “By Kerry Moonlight,” 1889. 1. How a thriftless young farmer
went in for anti-rent agitation and brought ruin on himself and his young
wife. 2. Story of a resisted eviction ending in tragedy. 3. The “moonlighter”
phase of the land war. All three stories are written to show the
wickedness and the uncalled for nature of the land agitation. They are nicely
written and constitute a clever piece of special pleading. In 2, the priest is
represented as “heartily sympathetic with the Cause but utterly unsympathetic
with gratuitous demonstrations of mass violence.”</p>

<p>A tale of the Fenian rising by the daughter of William Smith O’Brien.
A double love story runs through the book. The descriptions of the scenery
of the Shannon and neighbouring districts are derived from livelong observations.
Tone pure and healthy, dialect perfect. Of this story Stephen Gwynn
says: “Violent, even melodramatic, in incident, it lacks the power of characterisation,
but it has many passages of beauty.... She worked largely
upon material gathered from the lips of men who had been actors in the
Fenian rising.”</p>

<p>Twelve stories of various types. Some have a slight meaning behind the
mere tale. Four or five do not concern Ireland, and several others do not
touch peasant life. The tone is on the whole sympathetic towards the external
aspects of Catholicism. The stories do not deal in politics or in problems.
They are chiefly little aspects of life and feeling. The last and longest is a
very modern story of the love affair of Rev. Mark Dibbs and a certain Lady
Glynn.</p>

<p>A tale laid in a time of helplessness and hopelessness, in which the Author
gives “many illustrations of the beautiful and devoted love that has ever
bound together the people and the priests of Ireland.”—(<i>Pref.</i>). The Author
tells us that every one of the main incidents is based on fact, and that many
of the characters are portraits of real persons. The story is told with great
vigour, and is full of diversified incident of no humdrum or commonplace
character.—(<span class="smcap">Irish Monthly</span>).</p>

<p class="book">⸺ WHEN WE WERE BOYS. Pp. 550. (<i>Longmans</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1890. Frequently
republished.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable of Irish novels. A tale of Ireland in Fenian
times. Scene: Glengarriff, Co. Cork. A very brilliant book, sparkling
with epigram and metaphor. Full of criticism, argument, thought and dream
about Ireland. The story itself is strong in romantic and human interest.
The characterization is full of life and reality, yet many of the characters
are types. In the course of the tale many aspects of Irish life, among all
classes, pass in review. There are many touches of satire. Over all the
characters and scenes the author’s exuberant imagination has cast a glare
as of the footlights, making them stand out in vivid colours and clear outlines.
Yet there is little or no distortion or misrepresentation. The Author’s sympathies
are strongly nationalist and Catholic, yet national failings are not
blinked, and some of the portraits of priests are distinctly satirical. The
central interest, perhaps, is the romantic excitement, enthusiasm, and exaltation
of an impending rising.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ A QUEEN OF MEN. Pp. 321. (<i>Unwin</i>). [1898]. Third ed., 1899.
There is a cheap ed. in paper covers.</p>

<p>Scene: Galway City, Clare Island, and the opposite coast, just before the
great War of the Earls. A very highly-coloured romance, full of flashy
and dramatic sensation, told with an exuberance of language that sometimes
exceeds, but at times is very effective. Some of the descriptive pieces are
quite above the common and attain remarkable vividness. The book was
written in the midst of the scenes described. An effective device to secure
colour is the frequent interjection of Gaelic phrases phonetically spelt. The
heroine of the tale is the famous Gránia Ni Mháille, who appears not only
as dauntless sea-queen of the O’Malleys, but above all in her womanly character.
Fitzwilliam, Bingham, and Perrott also appear, the last as a hero.
Though many of the incidents are quite fictitious and few happened exactly
as narrated, yet some of those which might seem most incredible to anyone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
unacquainted with the State Papers could be paralleled by real happenings.
Some of the incidents narrated are: the Composition of Connaught, the
disgrace of Perrott, the wrecking of the Armada on the Connaught coast,
Gránia’s visit to Elizabeth. With Gránia’s love story is entwined another,
that of Cahal O’Malley and Nuala O’Donnell.</p>

with the life of this family in Paris, and afterwards in Dublin. There is no
sensationalism. Rosette’s religious development is thoughtfully worked out,

mother and the old servant, Mélanie). The point of view is, of course, distinctly

<p>Seven stories reprinted from <span class="smcap">The Irish Review</span> and <span class="smcap">Orpheus</span> (an art
periodical). They belong to the literary movement associated with the
Abbey Theatre. They have the weird imaginativeness and the flavour
of the occult and uncanny of Yeats’s prose stories, together with the vivid
word-painting of “Fiona McLeod.” The Author delights in the portrayal
of primitive and savage passions on the one hand, and on the other in the
suggestion of the wild landscapes, rock-strewn and mist-shrouded, of Western
Donegal (<i>e.g.</i>, Glencolumbcille, in “Ancient Dominions”). These stories
of pure fancy are strangely interwoven with settings of extreme realism—drunken
tinkers, peasants, &amp;c. Only here and there have we remarks like
the following (p. 123):—“But those who are intimate with the soul of the
Gaelic peasant know that the God of the Christian is only one amongst a
Pantheon of hidden dominations lovely and terrible, though the priest at
the altar may thunder anathemas from a fettered intelligence,” &amp;c. The
reviewer in the <span class="smcap">Times Lit. Suppl.</span> pointed out the real defect of these stories—they
are wanting in heart.</p>

<p>The design is to illustrate, in all its cruelty, treachery, greed, and unscrupulousness,
the steady advance of the English settlement. Yet by no
means all the English are painted as villains. We are shown the forces of

Loftus and the old Earl of Kildare. Descriptions of battle of Glenmalure,
Hungerford’s massacre at Baltinglass, the capture and recapture of Glenchree,

homes of representative people of various parties, and long, imaginary political
conversations between the prominent men of the time are given. Then
there is a full account of the rebellion from the battle of Kilcullen to Vinegar
Hill. Practically every noteworthy personage of the time is described in
private and in public life. The romantic interest is entirely subservient to
the historical, yet there is plenty of adventure. The bias is ultra-nationalist.

<p class="book">⸺ ART MACMURROUGH O’KAVANAGH. Pp. 706. (<i>Gill</i>). [1885].</p>

<p>A full account of the life and exploits of Art MacMurrough, with many
adventures of fictitious characters, and much description of the manners
and life of the times within and without the Pale. In the conversations
the Author attempts to reproduce the spoken English of the time, with a
lamentable result. They are full of <i>yclept</i>, <i>eftsoons</i>, <i>by my halidom</i>, <i>marry</i>, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., so as to be unintelligible at times. The speech of the Irish characters is
nearly as full of Gaelic expressions. “Many of the events narrated in this
story are supplied from tradition,” says the Author. But she has been at
much pains to utilize undoubtedly authentic sources. The style, on the
whole, is pleasant.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE COURT OF RATH CROGHAN. Pp. 465. (<i>Gill</i>). 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>

<p>The story of the Norman Invasion of Ireland, together with the series of
events that led to it, and the consequences that followed, the central idea
being that it was the treachery and disunion of her own princes that wrought
the ruin of Ireland. All the chief men connected with the events narrated
play prominent parts in the story. St. Laurence O’Toole is finely drawn.
The last Ard Righ, Roderick, is shown weak and unfit to rule in perilous
times. Strongbow is a leading character; his death is vividly described.
Art MacMurrough is, of course, the villain. The style is somewhat highflown
and often loaded with antiquated phrases and latinized expressions.
Yet the story, apart from its historical value, which is considerable, has a
strong interest of its own.</p>

<p>In the course of this romance the whole history of the Wars of the Confederation
of Kilkenny and of the Cromwellian Invasion is related. The
story is described by the Author as “a very encyclopædia of tragedies.” The
Author is strongly on the side of Owen Roe O’Neill as against the Confederate

<p>A thin thread of narrative connecting much interesting and valuable information
about historical events and about the life of the people at the period.
The hero passes from England, then laid waste by the wars of Stephen’s
reign, to Ireland, where we are shown in great detail the civil and ecclesiastical
life of the day. Thence he accompanies St. Malachi to Clairvaux on a visit
to St. Bernard. Then he visits Italy—Tivoli, Horace’s Sabine Farm, and
Rome, whose antiquities are described at length. Finally, he returns to
Ireland, whose state is again dwelt upon. The narrative is relieved by
exciting adventures and by stories told incidentally. The Author’s erudition
is extensive and accurate. The title refers to St. Patrick’s Purgatory, Lough
Derg.</p>

within a few months. 1914.</p>

<p>An anti-clerical and modernist novel by an Author with inside knowledge
of the Catholic Church in Ireland. It is the story of a young priest from
his birth until we take leave of him (<i>défroqué</i>) on board a ship leaving Ireland.
In the course of the narrative there is presented a general view of Irish life
as seen from the standpoint of such writers as M. J. F. M’Carthy, W. P.
O’Ryan, and “Pat,” but clerical life is depicted with far more minute knowledge
than by any of these. Sensational features such as the amours of
priests, nuns, &amp;c., are avoided, though much innuendo is indulged in. All
the estimable characters in the book are represented as either Modernists, or
else voteens and people who avoid thinking on serious problems. The Bishop,
Father Molloy, and Ralph’s mother, as depicted by the Author, are revolting
in the extreme. Except in rare instances all the outward details of Irish life
are true to reality, but seen with jaundiced eyes. It may fairly be said that
there is scarcely a page of this book that does not appeal in one form or another
to non-Catholic prejudice.</p>

<p>Maurice Blake is a young National Schoolmaster, an ideal teacher, an
enthusiast for Irish Ireland and for industrial revival. He falls foul of
Father Mahon, the P.P., who is made as odious as possible. Maurice cannot
get a dispensation to marry Alice Barton, a Protestant, and is compelled
to marry her in a registry office. Maurice is selected as candidate by his
constituency but, through the agency of Fr. Mahon, is set aside in favour of a
worthless drunkard, and a mission is preached by “Seraphists.” Ch. XXIII.,
describing this mission, is most offensive and vulgar. Minor characters are
Driscoll, the former Master; Breslin, editor and free-thinker; Fr. Malone, a
lovable character; Dr. Hannigan with his “diffident, humble manner covering
the pride of Lucifer”; Fr. Cafferley, fond of tea parties in publicans’ back
parlours, &amp;c. <span class="smcap">The Church Times</span> says of the book, “It is much more angry
and malevolent than its predecessor,” and the <span class="smcap">Times Lit. Suppl.</span>, in an
article obviously written by a non-Catholic, “It is a bitter and, if true, a
deadly attack on the priesthood, and an almost rancorous indictment of the
practice and influence of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland.”</p>

xxii. + 267 + 348. (<i>Sampson, Low</i>). 1878.</p>

<p>Described by the Author (Pref.) as “the reduction to its artistic elements of
the whole of that heroic history taken together, viewing it always in the light
shed by modern archæologians, frequently using the actual language of the
bards, and as much as possible their style and general character of expression.”...
“Through the loose chaotic mass ... I have endeavoured
to trace the mental and physical personality of the heroes and
heroines, and to discover the true order of events.” The chapter headings
read like those of a novel—“Only a Name,” “Perfidy,” “In Vain,” “Swift
Succour.” Vol. I. deals with the Fianna, Cuchulain, the Cattle-raid of
Cuailgne. Vol. II. is entirely taken up (all but the first 88 pp.) with the
Cuchulain cycle. The above work is carefully to be distinguished from the
Author’s <i>History of Ireland, Critical and Philosophical</i>. Vol. I. (all publ.)
pp. 468 (Sampson, Low), 1881. In the Pref. to this latter he says, “The
books already published by me on this subject are portions of a work in which
I propose to tell the History of Ireland through the medium of tales, epic
or romantic.”</p>

<p>Stories and pictures, nine in number, of Ireland in the days of Elizabeth
“not so much founded on fact as in fact true.”—(Pref.). (1) How a drummer-boy
saved Clan Ranal from destruction by the Deputy; (2) A sketch of
Philip O’Sullivan, historian, soldier, and poet; (3) The destruction of the
O’Falveys by Mac an Earla of the Clan M’Carthy; (4) The vengeance of
the O’Hagans on Phelim O’Neill; (5) A sketch of Sir Richard Bingham,
the infamous but mighty Captain of Connaught; (6) How the English
surprised by treachery Rory Og O’More and his people; (7) The story of
Brian of the Ramparts O’Rourke; (8) Don Juan del Aquila, the heroic
defender of Kinsale; (9) Detailed and vivid description of the battle of
the Curlew Mountains from the Irish point of view. These have all the great
qualities of the <i>Flight of the Eagle</i>, and indicate the same views of history—the
selfishness and frequent savagery of some of the Irish chieftains, their
hatred of one another, their constant readiness to submit to the Queen’s
grace when it suited—all this is brought out. Yet the Author is on the
side of Ireland: he dwells on what is heroic in our history, he paints the
Elizabethan deputies and their subordinates in dark colours.</p>

<p>The historical episode of the kidnapping of Hugh Roe O’Donnell and his
escape from Dublin Castle evoked in a narrative of extraordinary dramatic
power and vividness. The Author has breathed a spirit into the dry bones of
innumerable contemporary documents and State Papers, so that the men of
Elizabethan Ireland seem to live and move before us. The effect is greatly
strengthened by the vigour and rush of the style, which reminds one of
that of Carlyle in his <i>French Revolution</i>. The Author has peculiar and
decided views about Elizabethan Irish politics. “The authorities for the
story,” he tells us in his Preface, “are the <i>Annals of the Four Masters</i>, the
<i>Historia Hiberniæ</i> of Don Philip O’Sullivan Beare, O’Clery’s <i>Life of Hugh
Roe</i>, and the <i>Calendar of State Papers, Ireland</i>, from 1587 forward.”</p>

The Irish text is presented in a difficult and archaic dialect, much as if, says
a critic, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> and the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> were to be printed
in the dialect of Chaucer. The Author in his Preface discusses and describes
his sources most minutely. Forty years of study intervened between the
Author’s previous publication, <i>Diarmaid and Grainne</i>, for the Ossianic Society
(1853), and this. The English of his translation, though sometimes affected,
is vigorous, rich, varied, often picturesque and on the whole thoroughly

permanent form. The following are the titles:—</p>

<p class="book"><i>Craobh Ruadh; or, the Red Branch Knights.</i> Two parts. 1910.</p>

<p>This is partly a serious study of the subject, partly a retelling of the old
sagas.</p>

<p class="book"><i>The Tuatha de Danaan; or, the Children of Dana.</i> Two parts.</p>

<p class="book"><i>Links with the Past.</i> Containing “Lug-na-Gall” (a legend of 1642), “Green
are the Distant Hills,” “The Origin of Lough Gill,” “Melcha,” “The
Wooing of Eithne.”</p>

<p class="book"><i>The Coming of the Children of Miledh.</i></p>

<p class="book"><i>Finn MacCoole.</i></p>

<p class="book"><i>Biroge of the Mountain</i>, and Other Tales, viz.:—“The Recovery of the Táin
Bo Cuailgne,” “The First Water-Mill in Ireland,” “The Wooing of
Moriath,”—all tales of early Ireland.</p>

<p class="book"><i>The Return of the Red Hand.</i> A story of Dunamase, fortress of the O’Moores
in the year 1200.</p>

<p>These nine pamphlets are very well but not pretentiously written. They
are written with good knowledge of the period referred to, but are not overloaded
with archæology. In footnotes the pronunciation of the Gaelic names
is given phonetically. The first eight of these booklets, together with Fr.
Skelly’s <i>Cuchulainn of Muirthemne</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) form an excellent introduction to
Ireland’s Heroic Period and to our saga literature.</p>

<p>The Author came to America from Ireland in 1907. Agnes Repplier says
of the book: “These Irish stories are as good as good can be; gay, sad,
amusing, pathetic, human. I like the stories themselves; I like the way
they are told. They don’t suggest ‘plot,’ but bits of real life.” In the Pref.
the Author says: “Thoughts go back to the long restful days beside Galway
Bay, to the still evenings in the Cork hills.... These little stories are the fruit
of these moments of retrospection.” There is much dialect, well reproduced.</p>

1<i>s.</i> 1910.</p>

<p>A story, how much of which is fact we do not learn, woven round certain
real events of recent date, and in particular the stopping of a paper of which
the Author was editor. Many of the characters may be recognised as portraits
of real personages, among others the Author himself, Mr. T. P. O’Connor,
Geo. Moore, Mr. James McCann, Mr. Edward Martyn, and Mr. Sweetman.
The book is largely taken up with conversations in which the Author gives
expression to his peculiar views on many subjects. Many of these belong
to the class of ideas known collectively to Catholics as Modernism. Throughout
the book there is constant criticism of the Irish clergy, much of this criticism
being put into the mouths of “progressive” priests. The personages and
the series of events dealt with are highly idealized. Distinctly well written,
but somewhat “exalté” in style. Scene: Dublin and the Boyne Valley.</p>

the most odious light, in order, says the Introd., to warn Protestants that
it is the same monstrously wicked system as ever. Ignorance, squalour,
rudeness, and brutality are the terms constantly used to describe the Irish
peasantry. The tone is often facetious and sarcastic. The peasants, including
“Father McNavigan,” speak an extraordinary jargon. Appendices give

a Roman Catholic priest. This priest acts as a kind of providence to his
two children, and reveals himself only on his death bed. The Authoress
seems quite unacquainted with Catholic practice, but does not depict it in
a hostile spirit. The scene is partly in Ireland, but the only trace of Irish
interest is an occasional reference to a mysterious quality in the Celtic blood
of the hero and heroine, and the character of the poor girl Stella Delaney,

and a tyrant in his family, are neighbours and close friends till a misunderstanding
brings estrangement and leads to a tragedy, resulting in the separation—for
ever, as it proves—of Evelyn and her lover Terence Donovan. The
story is wholesome and human and free from religious or other bias. Aunt

over-firm landlord, hired agitator, attempt on landlord’s life. The
rent-payers are brutally murdered by leaguers, who are represented as drunken
and credulous. There is some good character drawing: Tinsy O’Halloran
the half-witted boy, is original: Father O’Riordan is represented as a good

<p>By the Author of <i>Rosa, the Work Girl</i>. Helen Wilson, whose mother was
Irish, inherits an estate in Kerry. After years of residence in India and
then in England, she comes to live in Ireland, grows to love the people, and
spends what is left of her failing life in teaching the natives the New Testament
in Irish. The interest of the book lies in its picture of and apology for, the
attempt made (chiefly by “The Irish Society”) in the first half of the 19th
century to convert the Irish to Protestantism through the medium of the
Irish language. The witness it gives to the bitterly anti-Irish feeling prevailing
in England at the time is interesting. The peasantry is represented
as debased and priest-ridden, but their condition is ascribed in part to English
hostility and to absenteeism.</p>

<p>Described by the Author as “a harmless romance, which, without aiming
to inculcate any great moral lesson, still endeavours to draw amiable portraits
of virtue.”—(Pref.). An old-fashioned novel in the early Victorian sentimental
manner. The plot is laid chiefly in Killarney (of which there is some
description) and Dublin, at the time of the earlier Napoleonic wars, when
Dublin had its parliament and was the centre of fashion. The plot is intricate,
but turns chiefly on the mischances and misunderstandings that keep apart
the hero, Felix Charlemont, and the heroine, Rose de Blaquière. This
latter name was the title of later editions of this book, <i>e.g.</i> (<span class="smcap">London</span>: <i>C. H.

a crafty French stepmother (once her governess) into marriage with an Irish
roué, and leads a life of bitter humiliation. But her honour is stainless
through it all, and there is a happy ending. Characters (<i>e.g.</i>, Larry McSwiggan)
are for the most part capitally drawn. The moral is good. The brogue
is well done. This Author, a niece of the Countess of Blessington, wrote

the romance <i>Manon Lescaut</i>. The present is a well written, though very
long, story, showing how the teller of the tale, the Dean or P.P. of Coleraine,
in Antrim, watched with more than a father’s anxious care over the fortunes
of his two half-brothers and sister. Their several characters appear admirably
in the telling, especially that of the poor good Dean, unworldly, unselfish,
deeply affectionate, but over anxious and almost over conscientious. His
efforts to keep his wayward charges in the straight path amid the allurements
of Paris are very well told. There is nothing in the least objectionable.
There is an air of reality about the whole, though the style is old-fashioned.
Towards the close the Dean acts as a Jacobite agent in Ireland.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE FOLK OF FURRY FARM. Pp. 315. (<i>Nisbet</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1914.</p>

<p>A story of life at Ardenoo, somewhere in the Midlands, depicting in
the most intimate way the conversation, manners, humours, kindliness of
the people. Told as if by one of themselves with the strange phraseology,
the unexpected turns, the often poetic figurativeness of the best shanachies.
Miss Purdon writes as one with close and accurate knowledge of the home-life,
at least in its outward aspects, of the small farmer class to which the chief
characters belong. The matrimonial affairs of Michael Heffernan and his
sharp-tongued sister Julia are humorously told, and the Author is almost
a specialist in tramps. Pref. by “Geo. Birmingham,” giving a sketch of the

<p>Religious and moral instruction conveyed in the form of a story of the
trials and sufferings (amounting at times to martyrdom) of a family of orphan
children at the hands of various types of proselytisers. A harsh and satirical
tone is adopted in speaking of American Protestantism. Incidentally there
are sidelights on several phases of American life, notably rail-road construction.

<p>“A narrative founded on the ancient ‘Prophecies of Culmkill’ and on other
predictions and popular traditions among the Irish.”—(Title p.). To keep
alive these traditions is the Author’s first aim, his second “to keep alive
and kindle in the bosoms of the Irish Catholic people of this republic genuine
sentiments both of patriotism and religion.”—(Pref.). Fr. Senan O’Donnell,
under sentence of death in town of Cloughmore, Co. Waterford, at the hands
of the British Government, is rescued by his brother. In the first part of
the book there is abundance of stirring incident, thrilling escapes, &amp;c., but
the latter part becomes more wildly improbable and unreal as it proceeds.
Fr. Senan is wrecked off coast of Clare and lives for years in a cave in cliffs
of Moher with a little boy, rescued from the eagles. Time: about 1750-1798.
Bitterly anti-English sentiment throughout. Only by an incident
in the last few pages are the title and sub-titles justified.</p>

<p>First appeared in <span class="smcap">The Weekly Budget</span>. A melodramatic but finely
told story. The principal incident is the historic tragedy utilised by Carleton
in his “Wild Goose Lodge.” Especially thrilling is the scene where Kate
Costelloe gives the evidence which she knows will bring her brother and her
lover to the gallows. Barney Fegan, a jovial pedlar, plays a conspicuous
part. The usual devices of evictions, murders, Whiteboys, traitors, trials,

<p>Adventures of an English ’prentice boy in company with Sir Ludar, who

<p class="book">⸺ THE BRACKNELS: a Family Chronicle. Pp. 304. (<i>Arnold</i>). 6<i>s.</i>
1911.</p>

<p>This unpleasant and, we hope, abnormal family is that of a self-made
Belfast merchant. The book is a study in temperaments; Mr. Bracknel
himself, a harsh man, with little humanness, without affection, except a
certain regard for an illegitimate child of past days; the daughter Amy, in
love with Rusk, the tutor, and ready to go to any lengths to win him; the
wilful, selfish, elder son; above all, Denis, the youngest, morbid, dreamy,
the victim of delusions, engaging in strange pagan worship, yet with amiable
traits. There is not a trace of religion in the chronicle of this family.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ FOLLOWING DARKNESS. Pp. 320. (<i>Arnold</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1912.</p>

<p>A soul study in form of autobiography. The hero is a son of a Co. Down
schoolmaster. He is brought up amid uncongenial people and in uncongenial
circumstances, first amid the Mourne Mountains, then in sordid Cromac
St., Belfast. His soul sickens with the dreariness of the education, and
especially of the religion that is imposed on him, and the father, a hard,
unresponsive man, is perversely blind to the genius (an artistic and somewhat
moody temperament) and aspirations of the young man—with consequences
almost fatal. He is thrown back on himself. Hence intense introspection
and then an outlet sought in occult sciences. There is a love story, too,
but it is of minor importance. The book is but a fragment, and has no real
conclusion. The style is exceptionally good.</p>

<p>“One needs no knowledge of Belfast and its people to appreciate nine-tenths
of what Mr. Reid here describes; there can be no question that his
characters are true to life: the small family at the combined post office
and lending library; the hardworking, clean, and grim Mrs. Seawright,
her two sons Martin and Richard, her adopted daughter Grace ... all this
one thoroughly appreciates as one admires the sustained skill with which
in a succession of small strokes Mr. Reid builds up his admirable story.”—(<span class="smcap">Times

<p class="book">⸺ MARY DOMINIC. Pp. 296. (<i>Dent</i>). 1898.</p>

<p>The main theme is the seduction of a young peasant girl by the son of the
landlord, and the nemesis that overtook the seducer after many years. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
story is told with exceptional power and pathos. There is no prurient description,
unless one half-page might be objected to on this score. The peasants
are natural and life-like, but there is something strangely repellant in the
pictures of the upper classes. There are incidents bringing out the darker
aspects of the land-war. There is no anti-religious bias.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE WOOING OF SHEILA. (<i>Methuen</i>). 6<i>s.</i> [1901]. Second ed.,
1908. (N.Y.: <i>Holt</i>). 1.50.</p>

<p>A gentleman, from unnatural motives, deliberately brings up his son as a
common labourer. The boy falls in love with and marries a peasant girl,
whom he had saved from the pursuit of a rascally young squire. On her
marriage morning she learns that her husband has killed her unworthy lover.
She at once leaves her husband, but a priest induces her to return, and the
crime is hushed up in a rather improbable manner. As in the Author’s other
books, there is a subtle charm of style, delicate analysis of character, and
fair knowledge of peasant life.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE PRINCE OF LISNOVER. (<i>Methuen</i>). 1904.</p>

<p>Ireland in the early ’sixties. Has same qualities as <i>Mary Dominic</i>. Devotion
of the people to the old and dispossessed “lord of the soil” is touchingly
brought out. A pretty girl-and-boy love story runs through the whole.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE CHARMING OF ESTERCEL. Pp. 318. (<i>Dent</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1913.</p>

<p>A love story of Ireland in the days of O’Neill and Essex. The main interest
lies in the story of how Estercel is brought to love his cousin Sabia, and in
the adventures of the former, an O’Neill and the envoy of the great Hugh,
in Dublin and in Ulster. But the historical background is well painted
and the historical personages carefully studied. The hero’s wonderful horse,
Tamburlaine, is a strange and original “character” in the piece, and there
is a splendid description of how he carried his master from Dublin home to
the North. The Author writes with sympathy for Ireland. The charm of
the style is enhanced by her sympathy with wild nature and delicate perception
of its sights and sounds.</p>

certain aspects of the Arthurian legends, &amp;c. Ch. x. deals with Difficulties of

<p>A love story of the Co. Down about fifty years ago. Deals mainly with
the trials of a young lady, who suffers much from suitors with disagreeable
relatives. The characters are mainly drawn from a rather uninspiring and
unsympathetic type of Ulster folk. Perhaps the most striking feature is
the character of Berna’s mother, a vulgar, pushful, foolish woman. There
is humour not a little in the situations and characters. The story suffers

<p>Six stories, four having some concern with Ireland. The first tells how
the Banshee goes to London to warn the scapegrace son of an Irish family,
who is a clever surgeon, yet always plunged in debt. It is a study of a strange
personality. “A Vagrant Digestion” humorously relates the journeyings
of the hypochondriacal Vicar of Rathdundrum in search of health. “Mr.
Mabbot’s Fright” and “So Near, or the Pity of It” both illustrate the
honesty and the proper pride of the Irish. The latter is pathetic. The
former is humorous, is full of life and movement, and contains fine descriptions
of the coast-drive from Belfast to Larne in the old days, and of an exciting
run-away.</p>

Deals with the famous agrarian “Plan of Campaign” in the eighties, viewed
with Nationalist sympathies. Religion is not discussed. A number of men
and women of the educated classes meet to talk politics. They go to see
evictions, and vivid but heartrending pictures of these are drawn. A bad
landlord is killed by a gentleman named Considine. The latter’s friend,

the Protestant landlord class, as do most of the personages in the tale. Period:
1881: the Land League days. Scene: the Midlands and afterwards Dublin.
The first part of the plot turns on the agrarian murder of Mr. Lloyd, the
trial, and execution of the murderer; the second on Tom Lloyd’s being
suspected of a bank-robbery when the Lloyds are living in very straitened
circumstances. All through runs a delicately told and very sympathetic
love story. The land question is viewed from the landlord standpoint, but
discussed without excessive bitterness. Conversations natural and peasant
dialect good.</p>

(N.Y.: <i>Crowell</i>). 2.50. 1911.</p>

<p>A very handsome volume, beautifully printed and bound. Contents:—1.
The Celts in ancient history. 2. The religion of the Celts. 3. The Irish
invasion myths. 4. The early Milesian kings. 5. Tales of the Ultonian
cycle. 6. Tales of the Ossianic cycle. 7. The voyage of Maeldun. 8. Myths
and Tales of the Cymry. Elaborate Glossary and Index. From about p. 106
onwards the legends, sagas, &amp;c., are not simply discussed but told as stories.
The résumé of early Celtic history, with the customs, art, religion, and influence
of the race, is very valuable; but the main interest lies in his complete
survey of the cycles of Irish myth and legend. The editor claims that he
has “avoided any adaptation of the material for the popular taste.” Some
very unfortunate (to say the least) remarks about religion (see pp. 47 and 66)
might well have been omitted.</p>

Ancient Ireland. Pp. lv. + 214. (<i>Harrap</i>). 5<i>s.</i> Sixteen illustr. by
Stephen Reid. (N.Y.: <i>Crowell</i>). 1.50. 1910.</p>

<p>Introduction long, but very interesting, by the well-known man of letters
(author of nearly thirty volumes), Rev. Stopford Brooke. Deals with the
relationships and contrasts between the various cycles of Irish bardic literature
and their several characteristics—and this in a style full of literary
charm. The stories told by Mr. Rolleston (than whom few more competent
could be found for the work) are re-tellings in a style graceful and poetic,
but simple and direct, of ancient Gaelic romances, some already told in
English elsewhere, others now first appearing in an English dress. They are
drawn from all three cycles above mentioned. Source for each mentioned
at end of book. Some of these tales are already well known, such as Oisin
in the Land of Youth, and the Children of Lir. The style, it may be added,
has not the fire and the dramatic force of Standish O’Grady, but it has good
qualities of its own.</p>

<p>Period: reigns of Tuathal and Diarmaid O Cearbhail. Scene: chiefly
the district around Tara. Aims to present a detailed picture of the daily
life and civilization of Ireland at the time. Chief events: the murder of
Tuathal, the judgment of Diarmaid against Columbkille, followed by the
battle of Cooldrevne, and finally the Cursing and Abandonment of Tara.
The story is slight and moves slowly; there is no love interest. The historical
events are not all, perhaps, very certain, but the author has brought very
great industry and erudition (from the best sources) to the portrayal of the
life of the time. The edition (of 1889) was revised and corrected by Canon
U. J. Bourke, M.R.I.A., and is admirably produced.</p>

<p>Scene somewhere near Fethard, Co. Tipperary, during Land League agitation.
The Author’s sympathies are against the L.L. and for the physical
force party, often called dynamiters at the time. The book is full of the
agrarian question, viewed with bitterly anti-landlord bias. Eviction scenes,
boycotting, midnight conspiracy. Satirical portrait of the pious landlord—Catholic
attorney who battens on the miseries of the poor; also of various
landlord types. In the case of “Father Tim” the portraits shows all the
weak spots, but without bitterness or disrespect. See ch. 18, Fr. Tim’s
sermon against the dynamiters. Good picture of a dispensary doctor’s life
and difficulties. Well written, but rather a pamphlet than a story. It is
believed in many quarters that Rossa did not write a word of this story;<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
the edition I examined has on the title-page what purports to be a facsimile
of Rossa’s signature. Rossa was b. in Rosscarbery, Co. Cork, 1831. Died in
U.S.A., 1915, and was given a public funeral in Dublin. He was a well known
Fenian leader, was condemned for treason-felony in 1865, and sentenced to
perpetual imprisonment, but was subsequently released and went to New

In 1844 she went to Canada, where the rest of her life was spent. Between
1847 and 1874 she wrote frequently for the principal Catholic papers in
America. In 1895 she received the Laetare Medal. “Each of her
works of fiction had a special object in view, bearing on the moral and
religious well-being of her fellow Irish Catholics.” She says: “It is
needless to say that all my writings are dedicated to the one grand
object: the illustration of our holy Faith by means of tales or stories.”
Her sympathies are strongly nationalist. Besides the books here noticed,
she also published <i>The Red Hand of Ulster</i>, and a large number of religious
works. Flynn of Boston publishes a uniform ed. of her works at 0.60

tells how a change came over the wild young man, how he became a Catholic,
and married Bessy; how the two of them made their fortunes in N. Y., and
how Bessy came home just in time to stop the eviction of her father in the
Famine year. Readable, with touches both of humour and of pathos. Highly

<p>“A slight and very simple thread of fiction connects throughout the series

The plan is similar to that of <i>Hibernian Nights Entertainments</i>

Every night of his stay a story is told, the intervals being filled in by somewhat
insipid love episodes, long poems (by Mrs. Hernans, Longfellow, Gerald
Griffin, &amp;c.), and songs. The stories are a series of episodes from Geraldine
history from Gerald FitzWalter in Wales to the Sugán Earl, <i>c.</i> 1598, together
with a few miscellaneous romantic stories. They are simply and interestingly

and property amid the petty persecutions of the government and the intrigues
of rivals. Chief events introduced: battles of Pass of Plumes, Curlew Mountains,
and Bealanathabuidhe. Elizabeth, Cecil, Burleigh, the Northern
Earls, the “Sugán” Earl, Sir Henry Power, &amp;c., appear incidentally. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>

a single incident in this book—how could I, as none of them are my own

the stories were sent to me as first or second-hand experiences by ladies and
gentlemen whose statement on an ordinary matter of fact would be accepted
without question.” The names of some contributors are mentioned. The
stories are classified partly according to locality, partly according to the
type of ghost in question. A final chapter gives a kind of Apologia for the
book. Index of place names. The telling is, perhaps, a little monotonous
and dull.</p>

by the efforts of the hero, Capt. Martin Neville, to trace the murderer of a

1913. His books deal chiefly with Catholic clerical life in Ireland—a
subject which he was the first to deal with from within. He brought
to bear on the features and problems of Irish life a deeply thoughtful
and cultured mind. He did not indulge in thoughtless panegyric of
Irish virtues, but touched firmly, though sympathetically, upon our
national shortcomings and failings. His ideals are of the loftiest, yet
never of an unsubstantial and airy, kind. His style is influenced too
much perhaps in his earlier books by his very wide reading in many
literatures, but particularly in Greek, German, Italian, and English.
Besides the novels mentioned here, he has published two books of studies

<p>Story of life in a secondary school, near Dublin, nominally controlled by

standards of conduct and of religion are very low. Geoffrey’s faith is

Geoffrey loses all his worldly hopes and falls low indeed. He suffers the
shipwreck of his faith. But in this valley of humiliation he learns strength
to rise and conceives far different hopes, and we leave him on the heights of
atonement and of regeneration. The book is philosophic in tone, and is enriched
with many elevating thoughts from German, French, and English

<p>Into a sleepy, backward, out-of-the-way parish comes a splendid young
priest, cultured, energetic, zealous, up-to-date. He succeeds in many
reforms, but the moral of the whole would seem to be, “Nothing on earth
can cure the inertia of Ireland,” or rather, perhaps, “You cannot undo in a
day the operations of 300 years.” The old parish priest tells the story. There
is in the book intimate sympathy with, and love of, the people, their humours,
and foibles, and virtues. There is plenty of very humorous incident. Delightful
moralizings, like those in the Author’s <i>Under the Cedars and the Stars</i>. It
is full of undidactic lessons for both priests and people. The religious life of the
people is, of course, much dwelt on, and a good deal of light is thrown on the
private life of the priests. Transl. into French (<i>Mon nouveau vicaire</i>), Dutch

<p class="book">⸺ LUKE DELMEGE. Pp. 580. (<i>Longmans</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1901.</p>

<p>The life-story of a priest. The main theme of this great novel is the setting
forth of the spiritual ideals of the race and of the heights of moral beauty and
heroism to which these ideals can lead. A strong contrast is drawn between
the ideals which the hero sees at work around him during his stay in England,
and those which he finds at work at home. Many phases and incidents of
Irish life are shown—the home-life of the priest, the eviction, the funeral,
scenes in Dublin churches, the beauty of Irish landscape. One of the best,
if not the best, of Irish novels. Yet as a “problem” novel it is strangely
inconclusive. Luke seems to die with his life-questions unanswered. Trans.

<p>“Tainted blood, inherited shame, is a terrible thing amongst a people who
attach supreme importance to these things.” This is, perhaps, the central
theme of the story. The narrative opens in 1829 with the famous Doneraile
Conspiracy trial in Cork, when O’Connell, summoned in hot haste from
Derrynane, was just in time to save the lives of the innocent prisoners. The
story traces to the third generation the strange fortunes of the descendants
of one of the informers in this trial. There are glimpses of the famine of ’48
and of the spirit of the men of ’67. The story of Nodlag is a touching and
beautiful one, and the episode of the returned American is very well done.

<p>The conception is that of Tolstoi’s <i>Resurrection</i>, with the scene transferred
to Kerry. It is the story of how a young man of the Irish landlord class
determines to put to the test of practise his ideals of altruism. To this end
he abandons the society of his equals and lives the life of a labourer. He
finds how full of pain and heartburning and disappointment is the way of
the reformer. There are many reflections on the national character and its
defects are not whittled down. The book has two main themes—the greed
and callousness of Irish landlords, and the inability of the Englishman to
understand Irish character.</p>

<p>The interest of this novel centres partly in its pictures of clerical life, partly in
a charming love story of an uncommon type. The central figure is drawn
with care and thoroughness. He is a strict disciplinarian, a rigid moralist,
who worships the law with Jansenistic narrowness and hardness. But as
the story goes on we discover beneath this hard surface unsuspected depths of
human kindness. He himself finds out before the end that it is love, not law,
that rules the world. The story contains many beautiful and touching
scenes, and some fine description, notably in the South African portion of the
book. There is some incidental criticism of various features of Irish life—popular
politics, religious divisions, the Gaelic League, the change in the
mentality of the people, and there is in it food for thought about some of
our besetting faults. Considered by many to be the Author’s most finished
and most powerful work. Transl. into German, <i>Von Dr. Grays Blindheit</i>,

<p>Miriam is the daughter of wealthy Protestant parents in Glendarragh,
in the W. of Ireland. Her mother, on becoming a Catholic, is driven by
domestic persecution into evil ways, and subsequently disappears. Society
ostracizes Miriam, who, in revolt against it, goes to Dublin, where, in alliance
with a young visionary Trinity student, she flings herself into the Socialist
movement. Her efforts end in a disastrous strike. For a time she staves
off crime and tragedy, but it comes at last. Book III. brings her to New
York in search of her mother, whom she discovers sunk to the lowest moral
depths. The story hinges partly, too, on the lifting of the curse of Glendarragh
by Miriam and the hero, who makes her happy in the end. There are not
a few fine dramatic situations, but the plot does not hang together. The book
is meant to deal with Irish social and religious problems and to picture certain
phases of Irish life. The life pictured is chiefly that of the Protestant upper
classes, of whom a severe and satirical portrait is drawn. There are just a
few glimpses of peasant life. The Author raises more problems than he
solves, and the prevailing impression left upon the reader is one of gloom.

<p class="book">⸺ THE GRAVES AT KILMORNA. Pp. 373. (<i>Longmans</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1915.</p>

<p>An attempt to set forth the spirit of the Fenian movement of 1867, and
even to contrast it with subsequent movements, to the great disadvantage
of the latter; for the Author thought that the fire of Nationality has burned
very low since ’67. The heroes are James Halpin (apparently intended
for Peter O’Neill Crowley, who fell in ’67) and Miles Cogan, Fenians and
unselfish patriots. There is some good character drawing, but the interest of
plot and incident is slight, the chief interest being the vein of very ideal
philosophy which runs through the book. The Author is gloomy and pessimistic
about modern Ireland.</p>

peasantry, especially under the old land system. The Author was the wife

of her own Church. The heroine is a Claddagh girl, whose love for an English
captain, Jeffrey, is crossed by the fact that she is a Fenian. One of the

matrimonial affairs and the cruel interruption of these by decrees from Rome
provide the greater part of the incidents. The tone is not bitter towards

neighbours, petty boycotting, rural larking, full of sprightly and rollicking
humour. Chief characters, the petty county gentry. The peasantry are
drawn in caricature, usually friendly, and are shown in relation to their
social superiors, not in their own life and reality. If these sketches were
taken seriously, the peasantry would appear as drunken, quarrelsome, lying,
dirty, unconsciously comical—with scarcely a single redeeming trait. The
scene is south-western Cork.</p>

<p><i>All on the Irish Shore</i> has been described (<span class="smcap">Irish Monthly</span>) as “a blend of
Lover and Lever (in his coarser rollicking days) refined by some of the literary
flavour of Jane Barlow, but with none of the insight and sympathy of <i>Irish
Idylls</i>. The same may be said of the <i>Experiences of an Irish R.M.</i>, which
moreover, contains here and there passages needlessly offensive to national
feeling.” Titles of some chapters:—Fanny Fitz’s Gamble, A Grand Filly,
High Tea at McKeown’s, A Nineteenth Century Miracle, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Miss Rowan comes over to Ireland and takes “Lake View,” in the midst
of a hunting district in S. Munster. She falls in love—for the time—with
John Michael, handsome, and the most valiant of huntsmen, but a child of
nature whose whole mind is absorbed in hounds and horses. Hence complications.
The Author’s usual pictures of hunting scenes and happy-go-lucky
country gentry. Mrs. Delanty, the sharp and devious widow, is a
curious portrait. Dan Russell is scarcely more than a minor character in
the piece. It is a story about which we cannot speak favourably.</p>

<p>A kind of digest of the chief published translations of ancient Irish and
Welsh saga and romance, preceded by four short essays on the interest
of Celtic mythology, and the sources of our knowledge of it, the origin of
the Britons and their religion (44 pp. in all). Pp. 47-248 are a summary of

survivals of Celtic paganisms, and an Append. giving brief bibliogr. Index.
The myths and romances are not related as a tale is told; they are merely
placed on record, almost stripped of their poetry, along with all the extravagances
and absurdities that disfigure them, chiefly through modern corruptions.

1912. Publ. in U.S.A. under title <i>Mary, Mary</i>.</p>

<p>A study of the soul of a simple girl of the people and its development amid
the surroundings of a Dublin tenement house and of the Dublin streets—her
girlhood, her dreams for the future, her love affairs. The incidents are
quite subordinate to the psychological interest. The atmosphere of the
reality is carefully reproduced if somewhat idealised. There is nothing
morbid nor sensational in the book. This, the Author’s first published novel,
and many think his best, first appeared in <span class="smcap">The Irish Review</span>.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE CROCK OF GOLD. Pp. 312. (<i>Macmillan</i>). Many reprints.
1912.</p>

<p>Described, accurately enough, by <span class="smcap">The Times</span> as “this delicious, fantastical,
amorphous, inspired medley of topsy-turveydom.” A fantasy in which
human beings with Irish names, Irish gods and fairies, and the god Pan are
mingled to bewilderment. And the whole is leavened with what may or may
not be the Author’s philosophy. “Love is unclean and holy” ... “Virtue
is the performance of pleasant actions.” “Philosophy would lead to the
great sin of sterility.” These sentences are isolated from the context, but
they seem to indicate the general trend—the philosophy of Pan. However,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
there is much besides this in the torrent of wayward thought and fancy that
is here let loose. The pictures of nature are finely and delicately touched.
And there is humour of a strange kind not easy to define.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ HERE ARE LADIES. Pp. 349. (<i>Macmillan</i>). 5<i>s.</i> 1913.</p>

<p>Fragments of the Author’s peculiar philosophy of life conveyed in odds
and ends of stories and sketches. Some are pure fancy, some are very closely
observed bits of real life; some are humorous, with a kind of sardonic humour;
some whimsical, some border on pathos. Many deal with various phases
of married life. Little poems are sandwiched between the tales. The book
is full of aphorisms, indeed the style is a riot of curious metaphor, flights of
fancy, unexpected turns of phrase. The last piece (pp. 277-348) consists of
a series of disquisitions by an old gentleman in the style of the Autocrat of
the Breakfast Table. An Irish flavour is noticeable at frequent intervals.
The idiom (not the brogue) of Anglo-Irish conversation is well reproduced.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE DEMI-GODS. Pp. 280. (<i>Macmillan</i>). 5<i>s.</i> 1914.</p>

<p>The travels through Ireland of Patsy McCann, tinker and general rascal,
and his daughter Mary, in company with three angels, become tinkers for
the nonce. Patsy is a very human and a very real tinker, an ugly specimen
of a disreputable class. The wanderings of this strange company form a
thin thread on which is strung a medley of strange fancies, wayward comments,
scraps of very excellent description, and glimpses of low life in its most sordid
aspects (<i>e.g.</i>, the drab Eileen Cooley, who appears at intervals). There is an
effort to picture not only the outward doings, experiences, and sensations
of the tramps, but also their outlook, such as it is, upon life, their makings
of a philosophy, and the morality of the roads.</p>

engendered by oppression, takes possession of the young peasant, Ned Blake,

<p>A tale written around the strange phenomenon of a moving bog. Scene:

<p>Aims at presenting picture of early Victorian manners and morals as seen
in the life of this (rather unattractive) family, of Irish origin, but living in
England, and in their surroundings. It was a period lacking in ideals and

<p class="author"><b>THACKERAY, William Makepeace.</b> The great novelist paid only one visit
to Ireland (1842), the immediate outcome of which was his <i>Irish Sketch
Book</i> (1843). The tone of this book gave great offence to Irishmen
generally. Sir Samuel Ferguson severed his connection with the <span class="smcap">Dublin
University Magazine</span> because Lever, then editor, accepted Thackeray’s
dedication. He could speak of the Young Irelanders only in terms of
ridicule—witness his ballad “The Battle of Limerick”—though he
was a personal friend of Gavan Duffy. He derived some of the incidents
of <i>Barry Lyndon</i> from the chap-book, <i>Life of Freney</i>, which he read
one night in Galway. Many of the characters in his greater novels are
Irish, <i>e.g.</i>, “The O’Mulligan,” said to be founded on W. J. O’Connell;
“Capt. Shandon,” whose original was Dr. Maginn; “Capt. Costigan”
and his famous daughter, “the Fotheringay,” said to be suggested by
the dramatic triumph of Miss O’Neill, afterwards Lady Becher. “Ye
hate us, Mr. Thackeray, ye hate the Irish,” said to him Anthony
Trollope’s old Irish coachman. “Hate you? God help me, when all I
ever loved on earth was Irish!” and his eyes filled with tears.—(<i>Trollope</i>).

<p class="book">⸺ THE MEMOIRS OF BARRY LYNDON, ESQ. [1844]. Many
editions in all styles.</p>

<p>The autobiography of a blackguard and a cad, a compound of every vice—meanness,
mendacity, licentiousness, heartless selfishness. Add to these
swagger, vulgarity, and a fire-eating audacity, which, however, is always
on the safe side, and you have the portrait of the hero as painted by himself.
All the characters are vicious or contemptible or both, the English and other
foreigners no better than the Irish. Lyndon (real name Redmond Barry) belongs
to an ancient and decayed family, once aristocratic. The story tells how he
fights a duel at home in Ballybarry, falls in with swindlers in Dublin, deserts
from the army, serves under Frederick the Great in the Seven Years’ War,
becomes a professional but aristocratic gamester, marries (after a desperate
struggle) the rich Lady Lyndon, blazes through a brief season in Dublin
(1771), worries his wife into her grave, and finally runs through all his wealth.
There is some humour in places, but it is grim and sardonic, and does not
relieve the picture. Moral (see footnote near the close)—“Do not as many

<p class="author"><b>THURSTON, E. Temple.</b> His novels are for the most part a series of studies
or rather pamphlets on the action and influence of the Catholic Church
on human nature. His conclusions are usually hostile to that Church.
His writings give constant evidence of misconception of Catholic doctrine.
Incidentally Irish types and scenes are introduced, and the writer is fond
of comments on Irish life and character. Moreover, his first four books
aim at “brutal” realism, or naturalism. His recent book, <i>The City
of Beautiful Nonsense</i>, is a reaction to Idealism. Besides his Irish novels,
noticed below, he has written <i>Sally Bishop</i>, <i>The Evolution of Katherine</i>,
<i>The Realist</i>, and other tales (more or less anti-Christian in tendency),
and <i>Mirage</i>.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE APPLE OF EDEN. Pp. 323. (<i>Chapman &amp; Hall</i>). 1905.</p>

<p>An argument against the celibacy of the clergy, conveyed in the story
of a young priest—his childhood, inexperience, life at Maynooth, first experiences
in confessional. Here he meets the woman whom he had loved.
He tells her that, but for the fact that she is married, he would break all ties
for her sake. There is much study of Irish life (in Waterford), but the Author
has nothing good to say about anything Irish, country doctors and priests
being especially attacked.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ TRAFFIC. Pp. 452. (<i>Duckworth</i>). 1906.</p>

<p>Scene: Waterford and London. Has been well described by the
<span class="smcap">Athenæum</span> as a pamphlet in guise of a story, the thesis being that the refusal
of the right of divorce in the Catholic Church may lead in practice to results
disastrous to morality. This is conveyed in the story of a girl who leaves
an unworthy Irish husband, and goes to London, where, being obliged to
refuse an offer of marriage from an honourable Protestant, she takes to
the streets. Contains strange misconceptions of Catholic doctrine and
morality.</p>

bachelor, who tells his own story. Overhears in restaurant conversation of
a young man, from which he learns that the latter is about to marry a young
West Indian girl named Clarissa, but cares only for her money. Bellairs
is struck with pity for her, and determines to tell Clarissa of the worthlessness
of Harry. He goes to the W. of Ireland, where Harry had left her in charge
of two maiden aunts. She will not believe him, and goes to London with
Harry. He betrays and deserts her: she comes back forlorn to Bellairs,
and they are married. The writer has a keen feeling for nature, and there
is much description. The character study is careful and the style is full of
pleasant whimsicalities. The “Cruikshank” and “Bellwattle” of <i>The
Patchwork Papers</i> reappear here.</p>

<i>Harper</i>). 1.50.</p>

<p>A psychological study of an Irish woman’s character. Treats of Protestant
upper middle class society, but questions of creed do not enter into the book.
The scene for about the first third of the book is laid in Ireland, in an
out-of-the-way country district. Then it shifts to Venice, and afterwards
to London. In both places the heroine moves in a smart set, whose empty
life and petty follies are well drawn. There is a problem of pathetic interest
centering in two ill-assorted marriages. The part about Irish life, showing
the foolish pride of some of the Irish gentry, is skilfully and sympathetically done.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE FLY ON THE WHEEL. Pp. 327. (<i>Blackwood</i>). 6<i>s.</i> (N.Y.:
<i>Dodd &amp; Mead</i>). 1.50. 1908.</p>

<p>Middle class Catholic society in Waterford, pictured, without satire, in its
exterior aspects by one quite familiar with them. The heroine is an impulsive,
self-willed girl in revolt against conventionality. With her Stephen Carey, a
middle-aged man, conventionally married, falls in love and is loved in return.
The theme on the whole is treated with restraint, yet there are passionate
scenes. The complication is ended by the intervention of a priest, whose
character is very sympathetically drawn. The end of all is the suicide of the
girl.</p>

<p class="author"><b>THYNNE, Robert.</b></p>

<p class="book">⸺ RAVENSDALE. Three Vols. (<i>Tinsley</i>). 1873.</p>

<p>An attempt to represent the men and motives of the Emmet insurrection.
Point of view Unionist. Free from caricature, vulgarity, patois, and conventional
local colour. Scene at first in England, but mainly Dublin and Co.
Wicklow. Deals with fortunes of a family named Featherstone—loyalists,
with one exception, Leslie, who is a friend of Emmet. Michael Dwyer,
Emmet, Lord Kilwarden, &amp;c., figure in the tale. Love, hatred, murder,
incidents of 1803, Emmet’s trial, escape of Leslie and his ultimate restoration
keep up the interest to the end, when the real murderer confesses.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ TOM DELANY. Three Vols. (<i>Tinsley</i>). [1873]. 1876.</p>

<p>Begins with sale, in Encumbered Estates Court, of Mrs. Delany’s property
in the West. The family then emigrate to Melbourne, where the rest of the
story takes place. Most of the characters, however, are Irish, from Sergeant
Doolan to Mr. Brabazon. There are various love-affairs, ending some brightly,
others sadly; and there are pictures of life in the gold-diggings. Eventually
the estate is restored, and the family comes back to Ireland.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ STORY OF A CAMPAIGN ESTATE. Pp. 429. (<i>Long</i>). 6<i>s.</i> Several
editions. 1899.</p>

<p>A tale of the Land League and the Plan of Campaign, written from the
landlord’s point of view. The estate is placed near the Curragh of Kildare.
The chief characters are nearly all drawn from the Protestant middle and
upper classes. There is also a fanatical Land League priest, and a peacemaking
one, of whom a favourable portrait is drawn. “More cruel,” says
the hero, “more selfish, more destructive than our fathers’ loins is the little
finger of this unwritten law of the land—this juggernaut before which the
people bow, and are crushed.” The question is ably argued out in many
places in the book. The Author seems to identify the Land League with
the worst secret societies, such as the Invincibles. The tone is not violent;
there is no caricaturing, and no brogue.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ IRISH HOLIDAYS. Pp. 317. (<i>Long</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1898, 1906, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Story of an Englishman who goes down to spend his holidays with the
Rev. John Good, Curate of Coolgreany, somewhere in the Bog of Allen, six
miles from Birr and six from Banagher. Chiefly concerned, apart from a
few sporting incidents, with aspects of agrarian agitation. Traditional
English Conservative standpoint, accentuated by ignorance of Irish history
and present conditions, and by ludicrous misconceptions. Fanciful descriptions
of moonlighting, in which the peasantry appear as a mixture of fools
and ruffians. But little humour, and that unconscious. No objectionable
matter from religious or moral standpoint.</p>

experiences with the Ribbonmen.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ JOHN TOWNLEY. Pp. 346. (<i>Drane</i>). 1901.</p>

<p>A political novel, “the last of a trilogy of Irish disaffection.”—(Pref.).
J. T. is an Anglican clergyman who becomes a Catholic and, later, a priest.
He comes to Ireland, where he finds the priests immersed in politics and
using the confessional for political purposes. He is involved in circumstances
of a tragic kind, and to escape from a disagreeable situation he goes
to S. Africa, where he reverts to Protestantism. Dwells much on boycotting,
moonlighting and murder. Describes the Phœnix Park murders, the subsequent
trial, and the murder of the informer. The interest is exclusively
political.</p>

<p class="author"><b>TOTTENHAM, G. L.</b></p>

<p class="book">⸺ TERENCE McGOWAN, the Irish Tenant. Two Vols. (<i>Smith, Elder</i>).
1870.</p>

<p>Depicts, from the landlord’s point of view, the land struggle in the sixties.
This view-point is, in general, that “poor backward, barbarous, benighted
Ireland” owed whatever good it possessed to the landlord class: the influence
of the priest was evil: and Ireland’s troubles due mainly to the lawlessness
and unreasonableness of the people and the weakness of the government.
But the writer is not without knowledge of the people, and his pictures of
life are probably true enough in the main. The story is well told, and the
love story of Terence and Kathleen O’Hara and their sad fate is feelingly
related. The book brings out well the evil results of the rule of a thoroughly
unsympathetic landlord in the person of the English Mr. Majoribanks. An
idea is given of how elections were conducted at the time. This Author
wrote also <i>Harry Egerton</i>, <i>Harcourt</i>, and other novels.</p>

the public. He claims to have known the people, and was sympathetic
but anti-nationalist. It would be out of place here to dwell on the
place in English literature of the Author of <i>Barchester Towers</i> and <i>The
Warden</i> and <i>Orley Farm</i>, and the rest. An admirable contemporary
article on his novels will be found in <span class="smcap">Dublin Review</span>, 1872, Vol. 71,
p. 393. The following deserves quotation: “This Englishman, keenly
observant, painstaking, absolutely sincere and unprejudiced, with a
lynx-like clearness of vision, and a power of literal reproduction of
which his clerical and domestic novels, remarkable as they exhibit it,
do not furnish such striking examples, writes a story as true to the
saddest and heaviest truths of Irish life, as racy of the soil, as rich with
the peculiar humour, the moral features, the social oddities, the subtle
individuality of the far west of Ireland as George Eliot’s novels are true
to the truths of English life.”</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE MACDERMOTTS OF BALLYCLORAN. (<i>Lane</i>). 1<i>s.</i> [1844].
1909.</p>

<p>Scene: Co. Leitrim. Chief characters: the members of a broken-down
Catholic county family. Miss MacDermott is engaged to a Sub-Inspector
of police. This latter, because of certain difficulties that stand in the way
of their marriage, attempts to elope with her. Her brother comes on the
scene, and there is an affray, in which the Sub-Inspector is killed. Young
MacDermott is tried and publicly hanged. This is the mere outline. More
interesting is the background of Irish rural life, seen in its comic and quaint
aspect, by an observant and not wholly unsympathetic Englishman. The
portrait of the grand old Father John M’Grath is most life-like and engaging,
but the pictures of low life in the village and among the illicit stills is vulgar in
tone and the humour somewhat coarse. The book is spoken of by a competent
critic, Sir G. O. Trevelyan, as in some respects the Author’s best. The Author
himself considers this his best plot. It has been spoken of as “one of the most
melancholy books ever written.”</p>

Mainly a love story of the upper classes. Some clever portraits, <i>e.g.</i>, Martin
Kelly, the Widow Kelly, and the hero, Frank O’Kelly, Lord Ballindine.
Picture of hard-riding, hard-drinking, landlord class. A much more cheerful

enough but redeemed by great skill in the treatment, by admirable delineation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
of character, and by the drawing of the background. Absolutely cool and free
from partisanship, he yet draws such a picture of those dreadful times as, in
days to come, it will be difficult to accept as free from exaggeration. It
is a graphic and terrible picture. The noble character of Owen Fitzgerald is
finely drawn. There are touches of pleasant humour and of satire.</p>

<p>Story of an English Protestant family who buy a property and settle in

a novel. But the life and incidents of the period are well rendered, notably
the trials of people who are boycotted. Much sympathy with the people is
displayed by the Author, and, on the whole, fair views of the faults and
misunderstandings on both sides are expressed. The plot turns on the
enmity of a peasant towards his landlord, whom he tries to injure in every
way. The landlord’s little son is the only witness against the peasant. The
child is murdered for telling what he knows. There is some harsh criticism
of Catholic priests.</p>

<p>“Interspersed with remarks on the disadvantages, misfortunes, and habits

Through the medium of three stories, largely based on fact, the Author sets
forth instances of the sad aftermath of the rebellion, illustrating the tragic
consequences that may ensue if those in authority listen to the voice of slander
and condemn on suspicion. The stories are told to a Mr. Fitzmaurice by
persons related to the victims, and Mr. F.’s own romance is interwoven with
the tale. Incidentally the Author gives his own views on Irish politics,
views full of the most kindly tolerance and of true patriotic feeling without
<i>ráiméis</i>. He seems not a Catholic, but is most friendly towards Catholics.
He is strongly in favour of the Irish language, of land reform, and of the
higher education of women—astonishing views considering the period.</p>

Convent, Drogheda. Lived for many years in England, but now resides
in Co. Mayo. Her stories aim at the purely romantic. As they are not
concerned with the seamy side of life, their atmosphere is almost entirely
happy and ideal. They are never morbid nor depressing. They do
not preach, and are not of the goody-goody type. The style is pleasant
and chatty, with plenty of colour, often full of the poet’s vivid sense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
impressions. The tone is thoroughly Catholic, the sentiment Irish.
Mrs. Hinkson is a very prolific writer. Besides the novels mentioned,

descriptions of scenery, not too long drawn out. Much tender and unaffected
pathos.</p>

<p>Fifteen short pieces collected out of various English periodicals. The
scene of about half of them is an unnamed island off the West coast. The
scene of the other is Achill. The title does not cover the rest. Sketches
chiefly of peasant life, in which narrative (sometimes told in dialogue) predominates.
The stories are very varied. There are pathetic sketches of
young girls: “Mauryeen,” “Katie,” “How Mary came Home”; tales of
the supernatural, such as “The Death Spancel”; “A Rich Woman,” a
racy story of legacy hunting; while heroic self-sacrifice is depicted in “The
Man who was hanged” and “A Solitary.” The last two pieces in the book

Wicklow peasant lad, who loves all animals; the prodigal who returns after

Biddy is a winsome girl, and keeps the reader’s heart from the time we first
meet her with the homeless dogs of Dublin as her favourite companions to
the day when she weds the master of Coolbawn. The chief charm of the
book lies in the picture of life amid the splendid scenery of Connaught. The
book has a pleasant atmosphere of bright simplicity and quick mirthfulness.

<p>The three daughters of Sir Jasper Burke are of the reduced county family
class, about which the Author loves to write. The expedient of receiving
paying guests results in matrimony for the three girls. With this simple plot
there are all the things that go to make Katharine Tynan’s works delightful
reading: insight into character, impressions of Irish life, lovable personalities
of many types.</p>

<i>McClurg</i>). 1900.</p>

<p>“Another gracious Irish girl. Well educated, and brought up to a refined
and easy life, she applies herself to the drudgery of farm work rather than
desert her toiling mother; but the novelist finds her a husband and a more
fortunate lot.”—(<i>Baker</i>).</p>

[1900].</p>

<p>A typical example of Mrs. Hinkson’s stories. The main plot is a simple,
idyllic love-story. The hero, much idealized, is an Englishman who tries to
do good to his Irish tenants in his own way, and hence incurs their hatred,
for a time. The heroine is an heiress come of a good old stock. Several
of the characters are cleverly sketched: old Miss Lucy Considine and her
antiquarian brother, in particular. Scenes of peasant life act as interludes
to the main action, which lies in county family society. All the chief persons
are Protestants, but the religious element is quite eliminated from the book.</p>

their love affairs, the hindrance to their happiness, and the matrimonial
<i>dénouement</i>.”—(<i>Baker</i>).</p>

<p class="book">⸺ A KING’S WOMAN. Pp. 155. (<i>Hurst &amp; Blackett</i>). 6<i>d.</i> [1902].
1905.</p>

<p>Told by Penelope Fayle, a young Quaker gentlewoman, a loyalist or King’s
woman, but sympathetic to the Irish. Scene: a Leinster country house
in 1798. No descriptions of the fighting, but glimpses of the cruelty of Ancient
Britons, yeomanry, &amp;c., and of the dark passions of the time. Racy,
picturesque style, with exciting incidents and dramatic situations.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ LOVE OF SISTERS. Pp. 344. (<i>Smith, Elder</i>). 6<i>s.</i> [1902]. Third
ed. 1908.</p>

<p>The scene varies between the West of Ireland and Dublin. A love-story, in
which the central figures are Phillippa Featherstonhaugh and her sister,
Colombe: a contrast in character, but each lovable in her own way. The plot
turns on the unselfish devotion of the former, who, believing that her lover
has transferred his affections to her sister, heroically stands aside. We shall
not reveal the <i>dénouement</i>. The minor characters are capital, all evidently
closely copied from life. There are the elderly spinsters, Miss Finola and Miss
Peggy, and quite a number of charming old ladies, the country priest and
the sisters’ bustling, philanthropic mother, always in a whirl of correspondence
about her charities, and others equally interesting.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ A DAUGHTER OF KINGS. (<i>Nash</i>). 6<i>s.</i> (N.Y.: <i>Benziger</i>). 1.25.
1903.</p>

<p>The daughter of a broken-down aristocratic county family is obliged to
take service as chaperon in an English family. Careful study of girl’s lovable
character. Contrast between the pride and poverty of Witches’ Castle, Co.
Donegal, and opulence of English home.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE HONOURABLE MOLLY. Pp. 312. (<i>Smith, Elder</i>). Second
impression, 1903.</p>

<p>The Honourable Molly is of mixed Anglo-Irish aristocratic (her father
was a Creggs de la Poer) and Scoto-Irish middle class origin (her mother’s
people were O’Neills and Sinclairs). She has two suitors, one is from her
mother’s people, the other is the heir to Castle Creggs and the title. Both
are eminently worthy of her hand. She finally chooses one, after having
accepted the other. Has all the sweetness and femininity of Katherine
Tynan’s work. Is frankly romantic but not mawkish. There is no approach
to a villain. There is some quiet and good-natured satire of old-fashioned
aristocratic class-notions. The portraits of the two old maiden aunts are
very clever.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ JULIA. Pp. 322. (<i>Smith, Elder</i>). 6<i>s.</i> Second impression, 1904.</p>

<p>How a baseless slander nearly ruined the life of Julia, the Cinderella of
her family, how she was nearly lost to her lover, and by what strange turns
of fortune she was restored. The chief characters belong to two branches of
a Kerry family, whose history is that of many another in Ireland. Julia’s
mother is a splendid type of the old-fashioned Irish matron. There is touching
pathos in the picture of the Grace family (minor personages of the tale)—a
mother’s absolute devotedness to a pair of thankless and worthless daughters.
The old parish priest, too, is well drawn.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE ADVENTURES OF ALICIA. (<i>White</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1906.</p>

<p>“A characteristically winning story of a poor young Irish girl, who had to
serve English employers, but, in spite of all temptations, remained true to
her Irish lover.”—(<i>Press Notice</i>).</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE STORY OF BAWN. Pp. 312. (<i>Smith, Elder</i>). 6<i>s.</i> (<span class="smcap">Chicago</span>:
<i>McClurg</i>). 1.50. 1906.</p>

<p>One of the Author’s prettiest stories. Family of high standing falls into
the meshes of money-lender. The daughter consents to marry him—but
the plot need not be revealed. The scene appears to be Co. Kerry in the early
’sixties, but there seem to be some anachronisms.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ HER LADYSHIP. Pp. 305. (<i>Smith, Elder</i>). 6<i>s.</i> (<span class="smcap">Chicago</span>: <i>McClurg</i>).
1.25. Second impression, 1907.</p>

<p>Lady Anne Chute is mistress of a vast estate in Co. Kerry. From the
moment of her succession to the property she resolves to act the part of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
Providence in her people’s lives. She sets about improving their condition,
founding industries, &amp;c., and with full success. This is the background to a
love-story. Old Miss Chenevix, once a “lady,” but now living almost on the
verge of starvation in an obscure quarter of Dublin, is a pathetic figure.
Pathetic also is the devotion of her old servant to the fallen fortunes of the
family. Then there is the picture, drawn with exquisite sympathy, of the
poor girl dying of consumption, and of how her religion exalted and brightened
her last days. The descriptions or rather impressions of nature which brighten
the story are peculiarly vivid.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE HOUSE OF THE CRICKETS. (<i>Smith, Elder</i>). 1908.</p>

<p>A story of Irish peasant farmer life. The heroine lives, with her brothers
and sisters, a life of abject slavery, ruled by a tyrannical and puritanical
father. In this wretched home she and her brother, Richard, develop noble
qualities of character and mind. The members of the family are very life-like
portraits, and the picture of Irish life is drawn with much care and skill.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ MEN AND MAIDS. Pp. 294. (<i>Sealy, Bryers</i>). 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Illustr. by
Dorothea Preston. 1908.</p>

<p>A collection of short stories, chiefly thoroughly romantic love-stories.
“A Big Lie” is, however, of a different character, and the Author has hardly
ever written a more delightful story.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ PEGGY THE DAUGHTER. Pp. 335. (<i>Cassell</i>). 1909.</p>

<p>A romance of Ireland in early Victorian days. A young spendthrift nobleman,
a widower, runs away with Priscilla, a Quakeress, and also an heiress.
The description of the pursuit is exciting and dramatic. The penalty of
his deed is a long imprisonment, from which he issues a sadder and wiser
man. Priscilla’s care of his little daughter, Peggy, in the meantime is a
pathetic story. The plot suggested by the attempted abduction by Sir H.
B. Hayes of the Quakeress, Miss Pike, of Cork.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ COUSINS AND OTHERS. Pp. 319. (<i>Laurie</i>). 1909.</p>

<p>Eleven stories. The title story, the longest (there are nine chapters) tells
how a shabby branch of an old Irish family finally won recognition by means
of a marriage with the supposed heir and by the finding of certain old family
papers. Contains some goodnatured satire on the snobbishness of Irish
county society. One of the remaining stories is Irish in subject. All show
the Author’s best qualities—freshness, charm, and cheerful optimism.</p>

<p>The story of Maeve Standish’s self-sacrifice in the sorrow-shadowed home

<p class="book">⸺ THE STORY OF CECILIA. Pp. 304. (<i>Smith, Elder</i>). 6<i>s.</i> (N.Y.:
<i>Benziger</i>). 1.00. 1911.</p>

<p>Scene: Kerry and Dublin. Two stories, of mother and daughter, Ciss and
Cecilia, interwoven. Ciss’s fiancé is reported killed. She loses her reason
and persuades herself that a Dr. Grace, who is of peasant extraction, is her
lover come back. To save her from the asylum Lord Dromore, her cousin
and guardian, has to consent unwillingly to the marriage. The absent lover
returns, but she does not meet him for twenty years. Meanwhile Ciss’s
mésalliance is causing trouble in the course of Cecilia’s love for Lord Kilrush.
But all ends happily. The characters are mainly drawn from the
denationalised Irish upper classes. The story is told with much charm.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ ROSE OF THE GARDEN. Pp. 312. (<i>Constable</i>). 1912.</p>

<p>The story of Lady Sarah Lennox (1745-1826) in the form of fiction. A

for young readers. See <i>The Life and Letters of Lady Sarah Lennox</i>, edited
by the Countess of Ilchester and Lord Stavordale. Two vols. (<i>Murray</i>).</p>

<p class="book">⸺ A SHAMEFUL INHERITANCE. Pp. 324. (<i>Cassell</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1914.</p>

<p>“Katharine Tynan, in her gentle way, puts before us the growing up of
the boy Pat in ignorance of the disgrace (a jewel robbery) of his mother and
the suicide of his father, and the effect upon him of the disclosure. A lovable
and spiritual Father Peter plays a leading part in it all.”—(<span class="smcap">T. Litt. Suppl.</span>).
Pat finds his mother in time to comfort her deathbed, and in the end marries
an old friend. Somewhat vague, and not free from inconsistencies.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ COUNTRYMEN ALL. Pp. 238. (<i>Maunsel</i>). 2<i>s.</i> 1915.</p>

<p>A volume of stories and sketches, very varied in its contents, from well-told
but rather unconvincing little melodramas like “The Fox Hunter” and “John
’a Dreams” to very vivid glimpses of life, <i>choses vues et vécues</i>. These show
various sides of Irish life and character; an unpleasant side in “The Ruling
Passion” (a woman discussing her own funeral with her daughter), as
well as the pleasant and lovable aspects. “The Mother” and “The Mother
of Jesus” are little studies of exquisite tenderness. Several of the sketches
are humorous, for instance the weird episode, “Per istam sanctam unctionem,”
related by a priest. The scene of several seems to be the neighbourhood
of Dublin.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ THE HOUSE OF THE FOXES. Pp. 307. (<i>Smith, Elder</i>). 6<i>s.</i> 1915.</p>

<p>The Turloughmores are overshadowed by a curse made long ago by an
old woman wounded to death by the hounds of a former Lord T. when hunting.
According to the curse, every head of the house must die a violent death, in
forewarning of which foxes will be seen in twos and threes about the house
for some time before. The actual Lord T. is expected home from his yachting
cruise, his wife ever in dread of the doom. He is wrecked and apparently
lost, but Meg Hildebrand, who is staying at the castle, discovers the almost
dying lord in mysterious circumstances. He dies in his bed, his heir is married
into a lucky house, and the curse is said to be lifted. Founded on a legend
(still current) of a well-known Irish family. Many threads of various interest
are woven into the tale.</p>

Describes vividly the long struggle of a labourer against adversity,
the evils arising out of the competition for the land. A graphic picture of
the conditions of the poor. Scene: Co. Limerick in the years from 1847 to
1880 or so. The writer was a carpenter working at Ardagh, who afterwards
went to America. The chapters relating to a parliamentary contest are less
valuable than the rest of the book. Lecky, in his “<i>History of Ireland in the

<p>The Author was commandant of the Limerick City Artillery Militia and
son of Lord Gort. Chiefly heavy light-comedy, with conventional characters
and an air of unreality about the whole. The humour, the dialect, the
characteristics of the various personages, all are highly exaggerated. A
Lord Lieutenant, a Duke, the absurd Mr. and Mrs. O’Rafferty, the still more
absurd love-sick schoolmaster, ruffianly Terry Alts, figure, among many
others, in the tale.</p>

<p>The very varied and often exciting adventures of a poor waif. Rescued
from a travelling showman at Westport, Co. Mayo, he is sent to a poor school
in Galway, resembling the workhouse in <i>Oliver Twist</i>. Further adventures
bring him to Limerick, and then to Tralee, and afterwards to many other
parts of Ireland. The book is written in thorough sympathy with Ireland,
and in particular with the sufferings of the poor under iniquitous Land Laws,
though at times with a little exaggeration. There is a vivid description of
an eviction. Other aspects of Irish life are touched on, and with considerable
knowledge. Dublin, Belfast, Killarney, Bray, are some of the places described.
The spirit is Catholic: witness the kindly words on page 8 about
Irish priests.</p>

was all her life interested and actively engaged in evangelical work. She
was born in Limerick, 1835, died 1868. The story tells how a family of
Protestant landowners succeeded in distributing among their Catholic
tenantry copies of the Bible in Irish, and thereby converted a number of
them to Protestantism. The converts afterwards emigrate and settle in
America. Scene: apparently West Connaught. Throughout, “Romanism”
and “Romish” practices are contrasted with Protestantism, greatly to the
disadvantage of the former. The book is well and interestingly written.</p>

<p>Title-p.:—“Interspersed with moral and critical remarks; anecdotes
and characters of many persons well known in the polite world; and incidental
strictures on the present state of Ireland.” The hero is supposed to
be the son of a Welsh parson. The story opens in 1779, and is the love story
of the Lady Cecilia, daughter of Lord Ravensdale, and the hero, who turns
out in the end to be the true Lord Ravensdale. The story is full of incident.
Ch. xxii. brings the hero to Ireland. He has some adventures in Dublin,
which is partly described; then goes down to Ravensdale, which is seventy-six
miles from Dublin. He goes to the American war, and has many adventures
with Indians, narrow escapes, &amp;c.; but finally returns to wed Cecilia.
The story is highly moral and sentimental, with a religious tone. The
characters are mainly of the Anglo-Irish gentry—Lord Rivers, Lord Squanderfield,
&amp;c. The then state of Ireland is but slightly dwelt on.</p>

Excellent stories by a journalist very well known in his day. B. Wexford,
1795, he came to London in 1821. In 1823 he was appointed editor of the
<span class="smcap">London and Dublin Magazine</span>, in which he published his work on Robert
Emmet. From 1829 till his death he lived and worked in Liverpool. His
<span class="smcap">Liverpool Daily Post</span>, 1855, was the first penny daily paper.—(D.N.B.).
His son, E. M. Whitty (1827-1860), was a brilliant journalist, and wrote a
novel: <i>Friends in Bohemia</i>, and <i>Parliamentary Portraits</i>.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ ANCIENT LEGENDS OF IRELAND. Pp. 350. (<i>Ward &amp; Downey</i>).
6<i>s.</i> 1888.</p>

<p>A collection of fairy stories, legends, descriptions of superstitious practices,
medicals cures and charms, robber stories, notes on holy wells, &amp;c., taken
down from the peasantry, some in Gaelic, some in English. The legends, &amp;c.,
are preceded by a learned essay on the origin and history of legend, and the
book concludes with chapters on Irish art and ethnology and a lecture by
Sir W. Wilde on the ancient races of Ireland. Contains a vast amount of
matter useful to the folk-lorist, to the general reader, and even to the historian.
The stories are rather pathetic and tender than humorous. Wrote also
<i>Ancient Cures, Charms, and Superstitions of Ireland</i>, <i>Driftwood from Scandinavia</i>,
<i>The American Irish</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ JOHN THADDEUS MACKAY. Pp. 327. (<i>Burleigh</i>). (1889). 6<i>s.</i></p>

<p>In this clever novel the Author draws upon his recollections of early days
in Ulster. The hero, “a stickit minister,” goes out to India in company
with a “Howley” father, so named after a famous Archbishop of Canterbury,
and both learn charity and brotherly love and see the narrowness of their own
views through mixing with the natives. Many real personages are introduced
under thinly disguised cognomens, thus “Rev. Thomas Trifle” is the
late Rev. Thomas Toye, of Belfast.</p>

<p>A clever and interesting psychological study of the relations between
Swift and the two Esthers, Johnson and Vanhomrigh, the latter being the
chief centre of interest. The scene: partly in Ireland, partly in England.
The political events and questions of the time are scarcely touched upon,
but the atmosphere, language, and costume of the time have evidently been
carefully studied, and are vividly reproduced. Swift’s relations to these
two women are represented in a convincing and sympathetic manner. There
is nothing objectionable in the tone of the book.</p>

A plain tale, devoid of description, excitement, and historical “atmosphere,”
chiefly concerned with a family named Willoughby. The writer is anti-Puritan
but not pro-Irish. He mentions the deed of the traitor O’Connolly

<p>The king is “Edward VII. of England and I. of Ireland” (<i>sic</i>). Nearly
half the book is composed of minute descriptions of his reception in various
parts of Ireland. The rest is chiefly made up of long discussions (mostly
by the hero and heroine) on religion, divorce, loyalty, Irish history, the
position of the Church of Ireland, and landlords. The Author seems to be
strongly “loyal,” a High-Church member of the C. of I., an ardent Home-Ruler,
and a Gaelic enthusiast. But no bias is displayed <i>against</i> any class
or creed, though the Author does not seem partial to the landlord class,
unpleasant specimens of whom are introduced. Written with obvious
sincerity and earnestness.</p>

<p>A sensational romance of the Norman invasion of Ireland, very similar in
kind to the Author’s <i>For Church and Chieftain</i>, <i>q.v.</i> The Irish are depicted
as a wild, passionate people, torn by murderous feuds, led by selfish, unscrupulous
chieftains. The Normans, who appear in the story, Strongbow
in particular, are represented as gentle and courteous knights.</p>

<p class="book">⸺ FOR CHURCH AND CHIEFTAIN. Pp. 314. (<i>Mills &amp; Boon</i>). 6<i>s.</i>
1909.</p>

<p>A romance of the thrilling and popular type. Full of wonderful coincidences
and the still more wonderful escapes of the heroes from the clutches
of their enemies. The story is little concerned with historical events and
persons. The Earl of Desmond, Archbishop O’Hurley, Dowdall, and Zouch
are introduced occasionally. The tone is healthy, the standpoint Irish and
Catholic.</p>

with Morty Oge O’Sullivan, a gay, reckless, debonnair type of Irish chieftain.
On the other side are the brainless Whig fop, Sir Henry Morton, and
O’Callaghan, a spy in King George’s pay. The unfortunate love-story of
O’Callaghan’s beautiful sister and the happier love of the sister of Morty

converting to Protestantism some members of a poor family of Joyces in

say with Mrs. Hinkson in her <i>Reminiscences</i>, “All the world that cares
about literature knows of his work to-day.” He was for a number
of years actively interested in spiritism and magic, and there is more
of this than of genuine folk-lore in his writings. What there is of folklore
in them seems to have been gleaned during visits to his mother’s
people in Sligo. His prose is that of a poet full of changing colour

<p>Wild, formless tales, altogether from the land of dreams, told with the
Author’s accustomed magic of word and expression, but to the ordinary
reader well-nigh meaningless. In one of these tales some monks solemnly

food and lodging which they had given him. This tale may fairly be taken

<p>Disconnected fragments of dim beliefs in a supernatural world of fairies,
ghosts, and devils, still surviving among the peasantry. Told in a style
often beautiful, but vague and elusive, by a latter-day “pagan,” who would
fain share these beliefs himself. The talk of half-crazy peasants, the Author
tells us, is set down as he heard it. To the ordinary reader the book cannot
but seem full of puerilities. The peasants of whom the Author speaks are
chiefly those of North-Eastern Sligo.</p>

by Maud Gonne. 1910.</p>

<p>Tales of the ancient days of De Danaan gods and heroes—of Angus and
Midyir and Lugh and the Gobhaun Saor. Told in rhythmic and musical
language and with much beauty of expression, but most of the tales are
altered quite out of their antique and primitive form by a strong flavour of
modern mysticism and symbolism of the school of Yeats and A. E. “Conary
Mor,” the finest (we think) of the tales, is perhaps freest from this. The
first two or three are most influenced by it. Tales like “A Good Action,”
“The Sheepskin,” strike a different and, as it seems to us, a discordant note,
viz., broadly comical episodes, in which the actors are gods. Includes The
Children of Lir and the Children of Turann (under title “The Eric Fine of
Lugh”), and the Coming of Lugh. Original and artistic Celtic cover design,
head-pieces, and tail-pieces. Four coloured illustr. The first two are mystic
and symbolic. Most Catholics would consider them very much out of place
here. The book is beautifully produced.</p>

<p class="inline-heading"><b>1. IRISH LITERATURE.</b> Ten Vols. 4126 pp., exclusive of introductory
essays, which average over 20 pp.</p>

<p>Originally published by John D. Morris &amp; Co. Afterwards taken over by
the De Bower Elliot Co., Chicago, and brought out in 1904.</p>

<p>Edited by Justin M’Carthy, M.P., with the help of an advisory committee,
including Stephen Gwynn, M.P., Lady Gregory, Standish O’Grady, D. J.
O’Donoghue, Douglas Hyde, LL.D., J. E. Redmond, M.P., G. W. Russell
(“A. E.”), J. J. Roche, LL.D., of the <span class="smcap">Boston Pilot</span>, Prof. W. P. Trent,
of Columbia University, Prof. F. N. Robinson, of Harvard, H. S. Pancoast,
and W. P. Ryan; with Charles Welsh as Managing Director.</p>

<p><i>Scope and Object</i>: To give a comprehensive, if rapid, view of the whole
development of Irish Literature from its earliest days. In the words of the
Editor, it is “an illustrated catalog of Ireland’s literary contributions to
mankind’s intellectual store.”</p>

<p><i>The Choice of Extracts</i> is determined by two canons: literary value and
human interest. The Library gives examples of “all that is best, brightest,
most attractive, readable, and amusing,” in the writings of Irish authors.
There is no dry-as-dust. The extracts comprise mythology, legend, folklore,
poems, songs, street-ballads, essays, oratory, history, science, memoirs,
fiction, travel, drama, wit, and humour. The vast majority are chosen as
being specially expressive of Irish nationality. Choice is made both from
the Gaelic and the Anglo-Irish literatures, but the ancient Gaelic literature
is given solely in translation. A volume (the tenth) is given to <i>modern</i> Gaelic
literature, the Irish text and English translation being given on opposite
pages. This volume also contains brief biographies of ancient Gaelic authors.
The extracts are never short and scrappy, but nearly always complete in themselves.</p>

<p><i>Other Special Features</i>: Three hundred and fifty Irish authors are represented
by extracts. Of these one hundred and twenty are contemporaries,
the great modern intellectual revival being thus very fully represented.</p>

<p>The extracts are given under the name of the authors, and these names
are arranged alphabetically, beginning in Vol. I. with Mrs. Alexander, and
ending with W. B. Yeats in Vol. IX.</p>

<p>To the extracts from each author there is prefixed a biographical notice,
including, in many cases, a literary appreciation by a competent authority,
and a fairly full bibliography.</p>

<p>Each volume contains an article, by a distinguished writer, on some special
department of Irish literature. Thus, the Editor-in-Chief gives a general
survey of the whole subject. W. B. Yeats writes on Irish Poetry, Douglas
Hyde on Early Irish Literature, Dr. Sigerson on Ireland’s Influence on European
Literature, Maurice Francis Egan on Irish Novels, Charles Welsh on
Fairy and Folk Tales, J. F. Taylor, K.C., on Irish Oratory, Stephen Gwynn
on the Irish Theatre, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Index</i> of authors, books quoted from, titles and subjects dealt with—exceptionally
full and valuable (over 80 pp.).</p>

<p><i>Publisher’s Work</i>: 1. Illustrations, over 100 (several in colour), consisting
of facsimiles of ancient Irish MSS., and of ancient prints and street-ballads,
portraits of Irish authors, views of places, objects, scenery and incidents of
Irish interest.</p>

<p>2. Letterpress—large and clear type.</p>

<p>3. Binding—cloth, and half-morocco.</p>

<p>4. Price—has varied a good deal since first publication.</p>

<p><i>Editors</i>: Originally planned by C. A. Read, who collected matter for
the first three volumes of the original edition. Completed and edited by
T. P. O’Connor, M.P. New edition brought out by Mrs. Katharine Tynan
Hinkson.</p>

<p><i>New edition</i>: The original edition (1879) was published by Blackie. The
new edition contains about the same quantity of matter, but large portions
of the original edition have been omitted to make room for new matter,
which occupies the whole of the fourth volume and a large part of the third.
A new Introduction (pp. xi.-xxxiv.) has been prefixed. It is a general survey
of Irish literature.</p>

<p><i>Scope, arrangement, &amp;c.</i>: The authors are arranged chronologically. There
is first a sketch (full and carefully done) of each author’s life and works;
then follow extracts, as a rule very short, from his works. The principle of
selection is to give such extracts as would best illustrate the author’s style,
to avoid anything hackneyed, and “anything that would offend the taste
of any class or creed.”</p>

<p>In the original edition there was, perhaps inevitably, little of Irish Ireland,
still less of Gaelic Ireland. That has been to a certain extent remedied in
the new edition. But the old edition had the advantage of containing a
mass of information about little known writers and of extracts from curious
and rare books.</p>

<p class="inline-heading">⸺ A GUIDE TO THE BEST FICTION IN ENGLISH. Sq. 4to.
Pp. 813. (<i>Routledge</i>). 21<i>s.</i> New ed., enlarged and thoroughly revised.
[1902, <i>Sonnenschein</i>]. 1913.</p>

<p>This new edition is a superb work, deserving the title of an Encyclopedia
of English Fiction. It gives information in descriptive notes of between
7,000 and 8,000 works of fiction, including particulars of publishers (both in
England and in U.S.A.), prices, and date of publication. It comprises every
description of novel, translations of important continental and even non-European
fiction, and of early stories and sagas from the Norse and from
Celtic languages. The Guide is selective—not everything in the novel line
is included—but it is most comprehensive. The <i>arrangement</i> is first by
nationalities (English, American, Celtic, pp. 517-521, French, &amp;c.). Each
of these divisions is subdivided according to the century in which the book
was published, and the entries under the various centuries are arranged
alphabetically according to names of authors. The <i>Index</i>, which runs to
170 pp., gives full reference to Authors, Titles, and Subjects. Every specific
subject illustrated in the works is indexed with extraordinary accuracy and
completeness.</p>

<p class="inline-heading">4. ⸺ A GUIDE TO HISTORICAL FICTION. Pp. xii. + 566. 1914.</p>

<p>A new ed. of the Author’s <i>History in Fiction</i>; a companion to the preceding
and uniform with it in size, publisher, and price. As in the case of the former
work, full bibliographical particulars and descriptive notes are given. The
main <i>arrangement</i> is according to countries. Under each country it is chronological.
The Index (140 pp.) gives information as full as in the preceding
work. The standard of selection is “the extent to which a story illustrates
any given period of history.”—(<i>Pref.</i>). Ireland is not dealt with separately,
the history of the British Isles being taken as a whole.</p>

fiction dealing with past times.”—(<i>Pref.</i>). Full bibliographical particulars
(date, price, publisher) are given about each book. In most cases a short
descriptive note is added. The entries average seven on a page. The titles
are arranged first in order of countries. Thus in Vol. I., pp. 1-128 deal with
English History; pp. 129-154, with Scotch; pp. 155-167, with Irish, and
so on. Vol. II., pp. 1-56, U.S.A.; pp. 61-117, France; pp. 118-131, Germany,
and so on. The books dealing with the history of each particular country
are arranged in order of date. A copious Author, Title, and Subject Index
is appended to each volume. We retain the note on this book as, though
now in a sense out of date, it is still in print, and its price makes it more
generally available than is the new edition.</p>

Each is separately indexed. Each part is arranged in chronological order.
The titles of the books, the author and publisher, the subject are arranged
in three vertical columns. Prices are not given. On pp. 119 <i>sq.</i> there is a

treated by the novelists, <i>e.g.</i>, 1782-1850, based on O’Neill Daunt’s <i>Eighty-five
Years of Irish History</i>, Justin M’Carthy’s <i>Outline</i>, J. E. Walshe’s <i>Ireland

novels of Irish life by Irish writers whose literary activity began before
1850.” Throughout copious quotations are made.</p>

<p><i>Treatment</i>: Wholly free from bias. Marked by broad-minded, judicial
spirit, thorough interest in and sympathy with the subject, wide knowledge,
and a remarkable gift of literary characterization. On the whole a work
which I can scarcely praise too highly.</p>

<p>This excellent little periodical, edited by Dr. J. S. Crone, Kensal Lodge,
Kensal Green, London, N.W., is entirely devoted to Irish books and their
authors, and is the only publication of the kind. Beginning in August, 1909,

the Irish novels that appear, has many articles on Irish novelists past and

<p>The main object of this Society is religious and moral propaganda, but it
aims also at fostering among the people an interest in their country—its
history, antiquities, ruins, scenery, &amp;c. Cheap popular fiction is one of the
chief vehicles of this propaganda, and it has published in the fifteen years
of its existence—it was founded in 1899—upwards of a hundred penny booklets,
besides the shilling series mentioned below. Nearly all these stories are
Irish in subject. Most of them are distinctively Catholic in tone, and a
number of them aim directly or indirectly at religious instruction. But there
are a fairly considerable number which simply tell tales of ancient Ireland
in pagan as well as in Christian times. The importance of the work of this
Society may be gathered from the fact that since its start it has distributed
over seven million copies of its publications. All that can be done here is to
give a list of the stories published by the C.T.S.I., indicating the nature of

<p>A new (Autumn, 1915) enterprise of <span class="smcap">The Talbot Press</span>, 89 Talbot Street,

well-known works by Irishmen about Ireland and new works. The Editors-in-chief
are Mr. Alfred Percival Graves, Prof. William Magennis, and Dr.

fiction, oratory, sport and travel, history, wit and humour, essays
and belles lettres, politics, biography, art, music and the drama. Each book
is in the hands of a competent editor, so that none of the books in the series
are mere reprints. The volumes have been designed, printed, and bound
(cloth, Celtic design in green and gold) in Ireland. The publication has

</div>

<p>There is a wealth of Irish fiction buried in the volumes of long extinct Irish
periodicals and others still existing. Most people will have pleasurable
recollections of stories read by them in one or other of the magazines which
they were accustomed to read in youth—recollections which are only occasionally
confirmed on a second reading in after life. I can still recall with
delight many stories of Irish and even of alien characters which appeared in
<span class="smcap">The Shamrock</span>, <span class="smcap">Young Ireland</span>, <span class="smcap">The Lamp</span>, and other periodicals—not
to speak of the numerous tales, serial and otherwise, which were a feature of
the weekly editions of the ordinary Irish newspapers. Perhaps in some
future edition of “A Guide to Irish Fiction” it may be possible to appraise
some of the more notable of these stories and their authors. Meanwhile,
it is worth recalling that in the old <span class="smcap">Dublin and London Magazine</span>, 1825-7,
there is much admirable Irish fiction, chiefly by Michael James Whitty and
Denis Shine Lawlor. The same may be said, in a more restricted sense,
of that in <span class="smcap">The Dublin Penny Journal</span>, <span class="smcap">The Dublin Journal of
Temperance, Science, and Literature</span>, <span class="smcap">The Irish Penny Journal</span>,
<span class="smcap">The Irish Penny Magazine</span>, and, above all, in <span class="smcap">The Dublin University
Magazine</span>, which in its forty odd years of existence added<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
enormously to the general body of Irish literature. A good word must
also be said for Duffy’s <span class="smcap">Hibernian</span> and <span class="smcap">Fireside</span> magazines, which carried
on the work down to about the seventies. <span class="smcap">The Irish Monthly</span>, most
valuable of all in its services to the literature of the country, encouraged
a host of clever novelists and sketch writers, though, as in the case of <span class="smcap">The
Dublin University Magazine</span>, much of its output has been gathered into
volumes, there is still much to be gleaned. Much of the work already referred
to is partly accessible in the libraries, but where is one to consult the stores
of fiction—often charming and mostly interesting—which appeared first
(and last) in the pages of <span class="smcap">The Shamrock</span>, <span class="smcap">Young Ireland</span>, <span class="smcap">The Irish
Fireside</span>, <span class="smcap">The Lamp</span> (especially during John F. O’Donnell’s editorship),
<span class="smcap">The Irish Emerald</span>, and other more recent magazines? So far as I know,
there are no complete sets of these in any library. But some of our best writers
began their literary career by writing for these humble periodicals, and even
authors who had arrived did not deem it beneath their dignity to contribute
their maturer work. But it is a large question how much of this fiction is of
permanent value. I have no doubt myself that a judicious collector could
make many discoveries if an enterprising publisher could be found to give
the results to the public. But perhaps that is not even worth discussing in
these stormy days.</p>

though my doing so involved certain repetitions in the following note.</p>

</div>

<h3>IRISH FICTION IN PERIODICALS.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></h3>

<h4>I.—DEFUNCT PERIODICALS.</h4>

<p>I should have liked to include in this work the fiction, at least the serial
fiction, that lies buried in the back numbers of Irish periodicals. I was
obliged to make up my mind, regretfully enough, that this was impossible.
All that I have found practicable is to insert here a general note giving the
names and dates, with occasional remarks, of some of the more noteworthy
of Irish periodicals, omitting of course such as contain no fiction.</p>

<p>Of the eighteenth century literary periodicals, such as Droz’s <span class="smcap">Literary
Journal</span> (1744-8) and Walker’s <span class="smcap">Hibernian Magazine</span> (1771-1811), it is
unnecessary to say much, as the little fiction they contain is not of a very
Irish character. But in Watty Cox’s famous <span class="smcap">Irish Magazine</span>, which began
in 1807 and ran to 1815, there are excellent Irish stories. To <span class="smcap">The Dublin
and London Magazine</span> (1825-27) M. J. Whitty and Denis Shine Lawlor,
both noteworthy writers, contributed Irish tales of a sympathetic and national
character. Whitty collected his into a volume, which is noted in the body
of this work. A serial about Robert Emmet and another entitled “The
Orangeman” ran in this periodical. Bolster’s <span class="smcap">Quarterly</span> (1826-31) and
<span class="smcap">The Dublin Monthly Magazine</span> (1830), afterwards revived in 1842-3 as
<span class="smcap">The Citizen or Dublin Monthly Magazine</span>, call for no special comment
though they contain a certain amount of fiction. The latter, for instance,
had a story of 1641, “Lord Connor of Innisfallen,” and, in the 1842 revival,
“Gerald Kirby, a tale of ’98.” Some of Carleton’s <i>Traits and Stories</i> first
saw the light in this magazine. <span class="smcap">The Dublin Penny Journal</span> (1832-6),
first edited by Philip Dixon Hardy, contains a large proportion of Carleton’s
stories, and many others signed McC., S. W., J. H. K., E. W., &amp;c. In fact,
it is full of matter interesting from an Irish point of view.</p>

<p>Then there was <span class="smcap">The Irish Penny Journal</span>, <span class="smcap">The Irish Penny Magazine</span>,
and <span class="smcap">The Irish Metropolitan Magazine</span>, 1857 <i>sqq.</i> This last was not very
Irish in tone; its eyes were upon the ends of the earth, but an occasional
Irish story such as “Life’s Foreshadowings” is to be found in it.</p>

<p>Much was done for Irish periodical literature by the firm of James Duffy.
Duffy’s <span class="smcap">Irish Catholic Magazine</span>, 1847 <i>sq.</i>, contains much interesting Irish
matter, but little fiction except a serial, “King Simnel and the Palesmen,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
which, however, seems to have been dropped after the thirteenth chapter.
Duffy’s <span class="smcap">Hibernian Magazine</span> appeared in the early sixties. It had many
of Carleton’s stories<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and several serials, such as “Raymond de Burgh, or
the Fortune of a Stepson, A Romance of the Exodus,” and “Winifred’s
Fortune,” a story of Dublin in the days of Queen Anne.</p>

<p>Other ventures of Duffy’s were <span class="smcap">The Illustrated Dublin Journal</span> (1862)
and Duffy’s <span class="smcap">Fireside Magazine</span>.</p>

<p>In the fifties came a periodical whose title seems a faint premonition of
the Irish revival—<span class="smcap">The Celt</span>, 1857 <i>sq.</i> It had a curious series of articles on
Ireland’s temptations, failings, and vices. There were sketches of the South
of Ireland by Aymer Clington, and C. M. O’Keeffe’s “Knights of the Pale”
ran in it as a serial.</p>

<p>The sixties were, as we have seen, catered for by some of Duffy’s ventures.
In the middle of the seventies appeared <span class="smcap">The Illustrated Monitor</span>, afterwards
<span class="smcap">The Monitor</span>, published by Dollard, a Catholic magazine which
ran for about eight volumes. Vol. I. contains two serials, “The Moores of
Moore’s Court,” by D. F. Hannigan, and “High Treason,” which is not of
Irish interest. Other serials that ran in subsequent volumes were “Julia
Marron, a tale of Irish peasant life,” by “Celt,” and “The False Witness;
or, the martyr of Armagh,” by A. M. S.</p>

<p>In 1877 <span class="smcap">The Dublin University Magazine</span> reached its 89th volume and
became <span class="smcap">The University Magazine</span>, losing thereby its distinctively Irish
character. In the forty odd years of its existence this magazine collected
a great body of first-rate Irish literature.</p>

<p>Then there was <span class="smcap">Young Ireland</span>, <span class="smcap">The Irish Fireside</span>, and <span class="smcap">The Lamp</span>
(especially during the editorship of John F. O’Donnell). In these and others
such some of the best of our Irish writers began their literary careers.</p>

<p>As we near our own times the number of periodicals of all kinds that have
appeared and disappeared—most of them after a very brief career—becomes
bewildering. But the fact that they have run their course within our own
memory makes detailed reference to them the less necessary. It is not
many years since <span class="smcap">The Irish Packet</span> closed its career, an excellent little popular
periodical that was edited by Judge Bodkin. The Irish Literary movement
produced several periodicals, for the most part perhaps somewhat exotic—<span class="smcap">Dana</span>,
<span class="smcap">Samhain</span>, <span class="smcap">Beltaine</span>, &amp;c., &amp;c. Their latest successor, and to our
way of thinking much the best of them—<span class="smcap">The Irish Review</span>—is only just
deceased. The Gaelic movement, too, has produced its periodicals, but
naturally most, if not all, of the fiction they contain is in the national language.
The two best of these, <span class="smcap">The Gaelic Journal</span> and <span class="smcap">Gadelica</span>, have most unhappily
come to an end, the former after quite a considerable career, the
latter after a short one.</p>

<p>I have said nothing of the provincial press, though there were excellent
literary periodicals in Cork and Belfast,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> nor of the weekly editions of the
ordinary daily papers, which sometimes contain fiction of very good quality.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to give here even a bird’s-eye view of the fiction of
the Irish-American press. I may, however, mention a very fine review, the
<span class="smcap">Gael</span>, of New York, which reached its twenty-third and last volume in 1904.
It has contributions from all our leading present day Irish writers.</p>

</div>

</div>

<h4>II.—CURRENT PERIODICALS.</h4>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Irish Monthly</span> may fairly, I think, claim mention in the first place
for, to the best of my knowledge, its forty-three years constitute a life longer
than that of any other still surviving Irish literary review.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> In it, under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
sympathetic guidance and the kind encouragement of Father Matthew
Russell, its founder and for forty years its editor, many authors well known
to-day began the making of their literary reputations. It contains many
serials, not a few of which have since appeared in book form. “The Wild
Birds of Killeevy” first ran in its pages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Irish Rosary</span> is in its nineteenth volume. It is one of the very few
Irish periodicals that has succeeded in maintaining itself as a well illustrated
magazine, and it has done so at the exceptionally low price of fourpence.
Fiction forms a large proportion of its contents, which are never stodgy nor
yet what is called goody-goody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Catholic Bulletin</span> is comparatively a new-comer, but already
quite a number of volumes, including Fr. Fitzgerald’s two books (<i>q.v.</i>), have
been reprinted from its pages. Its tone is thoroughly Irish.</p>

<p>Then there are innumerable little periodicals which, unlike the three just
mentioned, contain stories of an almost exclusively religious or moral character,
such as the <span class="smcap">Annals of St. Antony</span>, <span class="smcap">The Messenger of the Sacred Heart</span>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The excellent <span class="smcap">Ireland’s Own</span>, a popular weekly on the lines of <span class="smcap">Answers</span>
and <span class="smcap">Tit-Bits</span>, deserves a word of mention. Its library of reprints is referred
to elsewhere.</p>

<p>Besides these there are the weekly numbers of the daily papers already
referred to and the periodicals devoted to Gaelic literature, a list of which
will be found in the section of this Appendix, entitled Gaelic Epic and Romantic
Literature.</p>

<p>In America many periodicals publish Irish fiction from time to time, but
practically the only periodicals the contents of which are predominantly
Irish are of an almost exclusively political character. <span class="smcap">The Catholic World</span>
has published Irish serials, <i>e.g.</i>, in the seventies, “The Home Rule Candidate:
a tale of New Ireland,” by the author of “The Little Chapel at Monamullin.”
Several of Canon Sheehan’s novels first appeared in American periodicals.</p>

<h3 id="APPENDIX_D_II">II.—GAELIC EPIC AND ROMANTIC LITERATURE.</h3>

<p>I have thought it well to set apart from the mass of Anglo-Irish fictional
literature and to put together in a list that portion of our national fiction
which draws its inspiration from ancient Gaelic sources. To do this with any
sort of completeness, it would be necessary, of course, to deal with the whole
body of fiction that has been written in the Irish language. Reasons have
been given in the Preface stating why this task was not undertaken. A
further reason presented itself some two years ago, viz., the appearance of
the magnificent work published in 1913 by the National Library—<i>Bibliography
of Irish Philology and of Printed Irish Literature</i> (price 5<i>s.</i>). In this scholarly
work the literature of Gaelic epic, saga, and romance is scientifically classified
and described with the greatest bibliographical accuracy. For me to attempt
that task over again would be little better than an impertinence. It might
even be thought, and not unnaturally, that the present list is wholly superfluous.
Yet perhaps it may not be without its utility, owing to the fact
that in the work just referred to descriptive notes are not provided. This
list, then, is practically an excerpt from that work, with the addition of some
notes that may be useful. The notes will be found in the body of the book.</p>

<p>Many of our heroic legends and ancient sagas have been retold in English
verse. Though fiction in verse does not come within the scope of the present
Guide, yet it may be of interest to mention here a few of these poetic renderings
of ancient Gaelic tales. Sir Samuel Ferguson’s <i>Congal</i>, <i>Conary</i>,
<i>Lays of the Red Branch</i>, and <i>Lays of the Western Gael</i>; Aubrey de Vere’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
<i>Foray of Queen Maeve</i>; Robert Dwyer Joyce’s <i>Blanid</i> and <i>Deirdre</i>; John
Todhunter’s <i>Three Irish Bardic Tales</i>; Douglas Hyde’s <i>Three Sorrows of
Story-telling</i>; Herbert Trench’s <i>The Quest</i>; Katharine Tynan’s “Diarmuid
and Gráinne” in her <i>Shamrocks</i>; Mrs. Hutton’s stately blank verse translation
of <i>The Táin</i>; and, last year, Dr. Geo. Sigerson’s <i>The Saga of King Lir</i>;
also <i>The Red Branch Crests</i>, a trilogy by Charles L. Moore; <i>The Death of
Oscar</i> by Alice Sargant. Hector MacLean has collected in the Highlands
and presented in English verse <i>Ultonian Hero Ballads</i>, which, as the title
implies, are of Irish origin. For notes and bibliographical particulars of
the above see <i>A Guide to Books on Ireland</i>, Part I. (<i>Hodges &amp; Figgis</i>), 1912.</p>

<h3 id="APPENDIX_D_VI">VI.—HUMOROUS BOOKS.</h3>

<p>The word “humour” is used here in a wide sense to cover wit and comicality
or broad comedy, as well as humour in the strict sense of the word. The
present list is not a selection of the best samples of Irish humour. It merely
brings together a number of books which are entirely or mainly of a humorous
character. Humour of a greatly superior order is often to be found here and
there in books of a predominantly serious purpose—in <i>My New Curate</i>,
for instance, or in <i>Knocknagow</i>.</p>

with traits of savagery and of fanaticism.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
